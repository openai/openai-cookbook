THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED âAS IS.â EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT PROHIBITED BY LAW, WE AND OUR AFFILIATES AND LICENSORS MAKE NO WARRANTIES (EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE) WITH RESPECT TO THE SERVICES, AND DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, SATISFACTORY QUALITY, NON-INFRINGEMENT, AND QUIET ENJOYMENT, AND ANY WARRANTIES ARISING OUT OF ANY COURSE OF DEALING OR TRADE USAGE.

OUR AGGREGATE LIABILITY UNDER THESE TERMS SHALL NOT EXCEED ââTHE GREATER OF THE AMOUNT YOU PAID FOR THE SERVICE THAT GAVE RISE TO THE CLAIM DURING THE 12 MONTHS BEFORE THE LIABILITY AROSE OR ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS ($100). THE LIMITATIONS IN THIS SECTION APPLY ONLY TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BYÂ APPLICABLEÂ LAW.8. Dispute ResolutionYOU AGREE TO THE FOLLOWING MANDATORY ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVERÂ PROVISIONS:(a)Â MANDATORY ARBITRATION. You and OpenAI agree to resolve any claims relating to these Terms or our Services through final and binding arbitration, except that you have the right to opt out of these arbitration terms, and future changes to these arbitration terms, by filling out this formÂ within 30 days of agreeing to these arbitration terms or the relevantÂ changes.(b)Â Informal Dispute Resolution.Â We would like to understand and try to address your concerns prior to formal legal action. Before filing a claim against OpenAI, you agree to try to resolve the dispute informally by sending us notice atÂ legal@openai.comÂ of your name, a description of the dispute, and the relief you seek. If we are unable to resolve a dispute within 60 days, you may bring a formal proceeding. Any statute of limitations will be tolled during the 60-day resolutionÂ process.(c)Â Arbitration Forum. Either party may commence binding arbitration through ADR Services, an alternative dispute resolution provider. The parties will pay equal shares of the arbitration fees. If the arbitrator finds that you cannot afford to pay the arbitration fees and cannot obtain a waiver, OpenAI will pay them for you. OpenAI will not seek its attorneysâ fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines that your claim isÂ frivolous.(d)Â Arbitration Procedures. The arbitration will be conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, video conference, or in person in San Francisco, California or at another mutually agreed location. The arbitration will be conducted by a sole arbitrator by ADR Services under its then-prevailing rules. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including but not limited to issues relating to the scope, enforceability, and arbitrability of this Section. The amount of any settlement offer will not be disclosed to the arbitrator by either party until after the arbitrator determines the final award, ifÂ any.(e).Â Exceptions. This arbitration clause does not require arbitration of the following claims: (i) individual claims brought in small claims court; and (ii) injunctive or other equitable relief to stop unauthorized use or abuse of the Services or intellectual propertyÂ infringement.(f)Â NO CLASS ACTIONS.Â Disputes must be brought on an individual basis only, and may not be brought as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class, consolidated, or representative proceeding. Class arbitrations, class actions, private attorney general actions, and consolidation with other arbitrations are not allowed. If for any reason a dispute proceeds in court rather than through arbitration, each party knowingly and irrevocably waives any right to trial by jury in any action, proceeding, or counterclaim. This does not prevent either party from participating in a class-wide settlement ofÂ claims.(g)Â Severability. If any part of this Section 8 is found to be illegal or unenforceable, the remainder will remain in effect, except that if a finding of partial illegality or unenforceability would allow class or representative arbitration, this Section 8 will be unenforceable in its entirety. Nothing in this Section will be deemed to waive or otherwise limit the right to seek public injunctive relief or any other non-waivable right, pending a ruling on the substance of such claim from theÂ arbitrator.9. General Terms(a)Â Relationship of the Parties. These Terms do not create a partnership, joint venture or agency relationship between you and OpenAI or any of OpenAIâs affiliates. OpenAI and you are independent contractors and neither party will have the power to bind the other or to incur obligations on the otherâs behalf without the other partyâs priorÂ writtenÂ consent.(b)Â Use of Brands. You may not use OpenAIâs or any of its affiliatesâ names, logos, or trademarks, without our priorÂ writtenÂ consent.(c)Â U.S. Federal Agency Entities.Â The Services were developed solely at private expense and are commercial computer software and related documentation within the meaning of the applicable U.S. Federal Acquisition Regulation and agencyÂ supplementsÂ thereto.(d)Â Assignment and Delegation.Â You may not assign or delegate any rights or obligations under these Terms, including in connection with a change of control. Any purported assignment and delegation shall be null and void. We may assign these Terms in connection with a merger, acquisition or sale of all or substantially all of our assets, or to any affiliate or as part of aÂ corporateÂ reorganization.(e)Â Modifications. We may amend these Terms from time to time by posting a revised version on the website, or if an update materially adversely affects your rights or obligations under these Terms we will provide notice to you either by emailing the email associated with your account or providing an in-product notification. Changes will become effective no sooner than 30 days after we notify you. All other changes will be effective immediately. Your continued use of the Services after any change means you agree toÂ suchÂ change.(f)Â Notices.Â All notices will be in writing. We may notify you using the registration information you provided or the email address associated with your use of the Services. Service will be deemed given on the date of receipt if delivered by email or on the date sent via courier if delivered by post. OpenAI accepts service of process at this address: OpenAI, L.L.C., 3180 18th Street, San Francisco, CA 94110, Attn:Â support@openai.com.(g)Â Waiver and Severability.Â If you do not comply with these Terms, and OpenAI does not take action right away, this does not mean OpenAI is giving up any of our rights. Except as provided in Section 8, if any part of these Terms is determined to be invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, that term will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and it will not affect the enforceability of anyÂ otherÂ terms.(h)Â Export Controls. The Services may not be used in or for the benefit of, exported, or re-exported (a) into any U.S. embargoed countries (collectively, the âEmbargoed Countriesâ) or (b) to anyone on the U.S. Treasury Departmentâs list of Specially Designated Nationals, any other restricted party lists (existing now or in the future) identified by the Office of Foreign Asset Control, or the U.S. Department of Commerce Denied Persons List or Entity List, or any other restricted party lists. You represent and warrant that you are not located in any Embargoed Countries and not on any such restricted party lists. You must comply with all applicable laws related to Embargoed Countries or Restricted Party Lists, including any requirements or obligations to know your endÂ usersÂ directly.(i)Â Equitable Remedies.Â You acknowledge that if you violate or breach these Terms, it may cause irreparable harm to OpenAI and its affiliates, and OpenAI shall have the right to seek injunctive relief against you in addition to any otherÂ legalÂ remedies.(j)Â Entire Agreement.Â These Terms and any policies incorporated in these Terms contain the entire agreement between you and OpenAI regarding the use of the Services and, other than any Service specific terms of use or any applicable enterprise agreements, supersedes any prior or contemporaneous agreements, communications, or understandings between you and OpenAI onÂ thatÂ subject.(k)Â Jurisdiction, Venue and Choice of Law. These Terms will be governed by the laws of the State of California, excluding Californiaâs conflicts of law rules or principles. Except as provided in the âDispute Resolutionâ section, all claims arising out of or relating to these Terms will be brought exclusively in the federal or state courts of San Francisco County, California,Â USA.ResearchOverviewIndexProductOverviewCustomer storiesSafety standardsPricingSafetyOverviewCompanyAboutCareersBlogCharterOpenAI Â© 2015âââ2023Terms & policiesSocialTwitterYouTubeGitHubSoundCloudLinkedInBack to top
