Updated over a week agoTable of contentsAPI AccessChatGPT PlusAPI AccessOn July 6, 2023 , we gave access to the GPT-4 API (8k) to all API users who have made a successful payment of $1 or more. We plan to open up access to new developers by the end of July 2023, and then start raising rate-limits after that depending on compute availability. We are not currently granting access to GPT-4-32K API at this time, but it will be made available at a later date. ChatGPT PlusChatGPT Plus subscribers will get GPT-4 access on chat.openai.com with a usage cap. We will dynamically adjust the exact usage cap depending on demand and system performance in practice. GPT-4 currently has a cap of 50 messages every 3 hours. Please be patient though — we expect massive demand and will scale up and optimize our systems over the coming months. Note: this will not provide subscribers with access to the API.Related ArticlesHow much does GPT-4 cost?What is the difference between the GPT-4 models?Can I fine-tune on GPT-4?What are the GPT-4 rate limits?How can I use GPT-4 in ChatGPT?Did this answer your question?😞😐😃ChatGPTAPIDALL·EService StatusTwitterLinkedIn
