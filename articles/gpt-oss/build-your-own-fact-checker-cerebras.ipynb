        "\n",
        "**1) Retrieve Evidence with Parallel:**\n",
        "First, we use Parallel to query authoritative sources related to the claim.\n",
        "\n",
        "**2) Judge the Claim with Cerebras:**\n",
        "Then, we send the evidence and the original claim to Cerebras for evaluation. Here's where Cerebras's ultra-fast processing becomes crucial, where the LLM can analyze multiple pieces of evidence, weigh contradictions, and evaluate complex claims in milliseconds. And, the model returns one of three structured verdicts:\n",
        "- **True** — Evidence strongly supports the claim\n",
        "- **False** — Evidence contradicts the claim\n",
        "- **Uncertain** — Not enough evidence, or sources conflict\n",
        "\n",
        "Each verdict comes with an explanation and cited URLs, so we can trace the model's reasoning.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Why this matters:** This two-phase approach (retrieve → reason) is called **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**. Instead of relying solely on what the LLM \"knows\" from training, we use Cerebras to process fresh, real-world evidence at incredible speed. This dramatically reduces hallucinations and gives us verifiable, trustworthy results. And because Cerebras's inference is so fast, we can fact-check multiple claims in parallel [while maintainining ultra] low latency."

        "In recent months, a number of widely shared posts and articles have circulated online making bold claims about technology, science, and public health. One viral thread asserted that Apple released the world’s first smartphone in 1992, long before the launch of the iPhone. The post claimed the device had a touchscreen, mobile internet capabilities, and even early forms of voice control. In reality, Apple did not release a smartphone in 1992, and the first widely recognized smartphone, the IBM Simon, was introduced in 1994 with far more limited features. The iPhone, launched in 2007, is credited with defining the modern smartphone era.\n",
        "\n",
        "Another widely repeated claim stated that Mount Everest has shrunk by more than 500 meters due to rapid climate change. Several posts argued that melting ice and tectonic shifts had dramatically reduced the mountain’s height, supposedly confirmed by new satellite imagery. Geologists and survey data contradict this, showing that Everest’s height has changed only minimally over time. Recent revisions to Everest’s official height reflect improved measurement technology—not catastrophic geological change or the environmental collapse suggested online.\n",

        "A sensational article suggested that NASA announced Earth will experience 15 days of complete darkness in November 2025 because of a rare planetary alignment. This claim resurfaces every few years in slightly different forms, yet NASA has consistently debunked every version of it. Astronomers explain that no known configuration of planets could block sunlight from reaching Earth for even a single day, let alone two weeks.\n",
        "\n",
        "Another persistent piece of misinformation claimed that COVID-19 vaccines contain microchips designed for government tracking. Public health organizations worldwide have addressed this rumor repeatedly, stating unequivocally that no such technology exists in vaccines and that microelectronics cannot function or survive in biological environments in the way conspiracy theories suggest. Despite extensive scientific communication, this claim continues to spread across certain corners of the internet.\n",
        "\n",
        "More recently, a trending health blog claimed that drinking eight cups of coffee per day reduces the risk of heart disease by 70%. While moderate coffee consumption has been studied for potential health benefits, no reputable research supports the exaggerated 70% figure promoted in the article. Excessive caffeine intake can create health concerns for many individuals, including increased heart rate, anxiety, and disrupted sleep.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the tech sector, several posts gained traction by asserting that electric vehicles routinely explode in temperatures above 80 degrees Fahrenheit. Critics use this claim to argue that EVs pose unique safety threats. However, investigations by fire departments, insurance groups, and automotive engineers show no evidence of spontaneous combustion linked to moderate ambient temperatures. Vehicle fires—when they do occur—typically result from accidents, mechanical failures, or battery punctures, not temperature alone.\n",

        "Another claim circulating widely suggests that major tech companies are secretly restricting home Wi-Fi speeds to force consumers into new subscription tiers. Internet service providers and independent network analysts have found no support for this, noting that slowdowns are far more commonly caused by outdated hardware, overcrowded networks, or poor signal placement within the home.\n",
