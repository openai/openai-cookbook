        "# Fine-tuning a Multilingual Reasoner with Hugging Face\n",

        "Large reasoning models like [OpenAI o3](https://openai.com/index/introducing-o3-and-o4-mini/) generate a chain-of-thought to improve the accuracy and quality of their responses. However, most of these models reason in English, even when a question is asked in another language.\n",

        "In this notebook, we show how OpenAI's open-weight reasoning model [OpenAI gpt-oss-20b](https://huggingface.co/openai/gpt-oss-20b) can be fine-tuned to reason effectively in multiple languages. We'll do this by adding a new _\"reasoning language\"_ option to the model's system prompt, and applying [supervised fine-tuning](https://huggingface.co/learn/llm-course/chapter11/1) with Hugging Face's [TRL library](https://github.com/huggingface/trl) on a multilingual reasoning dataset.\n",

        "1. **Setup:** Install the required libraries.\n",
        "2. **Prepare the dataset:**  Download and format the dataset for fine-tuning.\n",

        "\n",
        "The end result is a multilingual reasoning model that can generate a chain-of-thought in English, Spanish, French, Italian, or German. You can even _mix languages_—for example, ask a question in Spanish, request reasoning in German, and receive the final response in Spanish:\n",
