    "This notebook provides a step-by-step guide on how to optimizing `gpt-oss` models using NVIDIA's TensorRT-LLM for high-performance inference. TensorRT-LLM provides users with an easy-to-use Python API to define Large Language Models (LLMs) and support state-of-the-art optimizations to perform inference efficiently on NVIDIA GPUs. TensorRT-LLM also contains components to create Python and C++ runtimes that orchestrate the inference execution in performant way.\n",

    "- Set up your environment with the necessary dependencies.\n",

    "- Automatically build a high-performance TensorRT engine tailored to your GPU.\n",
    "- Run inference with the optimized model.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You can explore more advanced features to further improve performance and efficiency:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Benchmarking: Try running a [benchmark](https://nvidia.github.io/TensorRT-LLM/performance/performance-tuning-guide/benchmarking-default-performance.html#benchmarking-with-trtllm-bench) to compare the latency and throughput of the TensorRT-LLM engine against the original Hugging Face model. You can do this by iterating over a larger number of prompts and measuring the execution time.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Quantization: TensorRT-LLM [supports](https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT-Model-Optimizer) various quantization techniques (like INT8 or FP8) to reduce model size and accelerate inference with minimal impact on accuracy. This is a powerful feature for deploying models on resource-constrained hardware.\n",
