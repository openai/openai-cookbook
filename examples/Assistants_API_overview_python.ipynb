    "The primitives of the **Chat Completions API** are `Messages`, on which you perform a `Completion` with a `Model` (`gpt-3.5-turbo`, `gpt-4`, etc). It is lightweight and powerful, but inherently stateless, which means you have to manage conversation state, tool definitions, retrieval documents, and code execution manually.\n",

      "Calculate the derivative of the function \\( f(x) = 3x^3 - 5x^2 + 6 \\).\n",

      "I will now use the `display_quiz` function to present these questions and then provide feedback on your responses. Let's proceed.\n",
      "assistant: Thank you for your responses. Here is the feedback:\n",
      "\n",
      "For **Question 1**, the correct answer requires using the power rule of differentiation. The derivative of \\( f(x) = 3x^3 - 5x^2 + 6 \\) is \\( f'(x) = 9x^2 - 10x \\). This is obtained by differentiating each term separately: the derivative of \\(3x^3\\) is \\(9x^2\\), the derivative of \\(-5x^2\\) is \\(-10x\\), and the derivative of the constant term \\(6\\) is \\(0\\).\n",
      "\n",
      "For **Question 2**, the correct answer is B) \\( a < 0 \\). The sign of the coefficient \\(a\\) in a quadratic equation \\(ax^2 + bx + c\\) determines the direction in which the parabola opens. If \\(a\\) is positive, the parabola opens upward, and if \\(a\\) is negative, it opens downward. Therefore, the correct choice is \\(a < 0\\). You chose A) \\(a > 0\\), which is incorrect.\n",
