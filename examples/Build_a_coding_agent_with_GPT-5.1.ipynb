    "# Building a Coding Agent with GPT-5.1 and the OpenAI Agents SDK\n",
    "\n",
    "GPT-5.1 is exceptionally strong at coding, and with the new code-editing and command-execution tools available in the [Responses API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/responses), it’s now easier than ever to build coding agents that can work across full codebases and iterate quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this guide, we’ll use the [Agents SDK](https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python/) to build a **coding agent that can scaffold a brand-new app from a prompt and refine it through user feedback**. Our agent will be equipped with the following tools:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **apply_patch** — to edit files\n",
    "- **shell** — to run shell commands\n",
    "- **web_search** — to pull fresh information from the web\n",
    "- **Context7 MCP** — to access up-to-date documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "We’ll begin by focusing on the `shell` and `web_search` tools to generate a new project with web-sourced context. Then we’ll add `apply_patch` so the agent can iterate on the codebase, and we’ll connect it to the [Context7 MCP server](https://context7.com/) so it can write code informed by the most recent docs."

    "\n",
    "With the Agents SDK, defining an agent is as simple as providing instructions and a list of tools. In this example, we want to use the newest `gpt-5.1` model for its state-of-the-art coding abilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "We’ll start by enabling `web_search`, which gives the agent the ability to look up up-to-date information online, and `shell`, which lets the agent propose shell commands for tasks like scaffolding, installing dependencies, and running build steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "The shell tool works by letting the model propose commands it believes should be executed. Your environment is responsible for actually running those commands and returning the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Agents SDK automates most of this command-execution handshake for you—you only need to implement the shell executor, the environment in which those commands will run."

    "In this cookbook guide, we built a coding agent that can scaffold a project, refine it through patches, execute commands, and stay up to date with external documentation. By combining GPT 5.1 with the Agents SDK and tools like `shell`, `apply_patch`, `web_search`, and the Context7 MCP, you can create agents that don’t just generate code—they actively work with codebases: running commands, applying edits, pulling in fresh context, and evolving a project end-to-end.\n",
    "\n",
    "This workflow is a powerful blueprint for building agents that feel less like tools and more like collaborators. You can extend this pattern to integrate agents into IDEs or code sandboxes, generate new apps from scratch, work across large codebases, or even collaborate with developers in real time."
