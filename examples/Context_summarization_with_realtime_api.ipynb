    "Build an end‑to‑end **voice bot** that listens to your mic, speaks back in real time and **summarises long conversations** so quality never drops.\n",

    "1. **Live microphone streaming** → OpenAI *Realtime* (voice‑to‑voice) endpoint.\n",
    "2. **Instant transcripts & speech playback** on every turn.\n",
    "3. **Conversation state container** that stores **every** user/assistant message.\n",
    "4. **Automatic “context trim”** – when the token window becomes very large (configurable), older turns are compressed into a summary.\n",
    "5. **Extensible design** you can adapt to support customer‑support bots, kiosks, or multilingual assistants.\n",
