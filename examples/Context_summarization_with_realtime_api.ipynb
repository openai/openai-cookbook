    "## 1. Overview\n",
    "Build an end‑to‑end **voice bot** that listens to your mic, speaks back in real time and **summarises long conversations** so quality never drops.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What You’ll Learn\n",
    "1. **Live microphone streaming** → OpenAI *Realtime* (voice‑to‑voice) endpoint.\n",
    "2. **Instant transcripts & speech playback** on every turn.\n",
    "3. **Conversation state container** that stores **every** user/assistant message.\n",
    "4. **Automatic “context trim”** – when the token window becomes very large (configurable), older turns are compressed into a summary.\n",
    "5. **Extensible design** you can adapt to support customer‑support bots, kiosks, or multilingual assistants.\n",

    "> 1. gpt-realtime supports a 32k token context window, though in certain use cases, you may notice performance degrade as you stuff more tokens into the context window.\n",
    "> 2. Token window = all tokens (words and audio tokens) the model currently keeps in memory for the session.x\n",

The Realtime API GA has releases a new parameter [`truncation`](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/realtime-client-events/session/update#realtime-client-events/session/update-session-realtime-session-configuration-truncation). This parameter automatically optimizes context truncation, preserving relevant information while maximizing cache hit rates."
