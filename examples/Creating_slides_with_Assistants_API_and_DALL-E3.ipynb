    "Creating slides is a pivotal aspect of many jobs, but can be laborious and time-consuming. Additionally, extracting insights from data and articulating them effectively on slides can be challenging. <br><br> This cookbook recipe will demonstrate how you can utilize the new Assistants API to facilitate the end to end slide creation process for you without you having to touch Microsoft PowerPoint or Google Slides, saving you valuable time and effort!"
