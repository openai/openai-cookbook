    "# Practical guide to data-intensive apps with the Realtime API\n",
    "\n",
    "This cookbook serves as a practical guide to help AI Engineers maximize the effectiveness of OpenAI's Realtime API, specifically when dealing with data-intensive function calls. We'll focus on scenarios common in speech-to-speech agents, where vast amounts of data must be handled smoothly and efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "This post won't cover the basics of setting up a Realtime API solution. Instead, you'll gain clear insights and actionable strategies to enhance the performance and reliability of your real-time conversational agents. It addresses specific challenges unique to handling large amounts of data in real-time conversational contexts."

    "Before we dive in, let’s quickly recap the API for those who are new. The OpenAI Realtime API is a recent offering that supports low-latency, multimodal interactions—such as speech-to-speech conversations and live transcription. Picture scenarios like real-time voice-based customer support or live movie transcriptions. "

    "Agents need access to tools and relevant data to perform their tasks. For instance, a financial analyst agent might pull real-time market data. In many cases, services already exist in your environment that expose this information through APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Historically, APIs weren’t designed with agents in mind and often return large volumes of data, depending on the service. As engineers, we frequently wrap these APIs with function calls to accelerate agent development—which makes perfect sense. Why reinvent what already exists?\n",

    "\n",
    "It almost goes without saying—when building function calls, your top priority is to design clear, well-defined functions. This makes it easy to trim response sizes and avoid overwhelming the model. Each function call should be straightforward to explain, sharply scoped, and return only the information needed for its purpose. Overlapping responsibilities between functions inevitably invites confusion.\n",

    "For example, we can limit the `searchDraftProspects` function call to return only general details—such as player stats—for each prospect, dramatically reducing the response size. If more information is needed, the new `getProspectDetails` function call provides expanded details. There’s no universal solution; the right approach depends on your use case and data model.\n",

    "The way you structure your data has a direct impact on how well the model processes and summarizes API responses. In our experience, clear, key-based formats like JSON or YAML help the model interpret data more accurately than tabular formats such as Markdown. Large tables, especially, tend to overwhelm the model—resulting in less fluent and less accurate outputs. Still, it’s worth experimenting with different formats to find what works best for your use case.\n",

    "\n",
    "Underlying models often struggle to transition smoothly from data-heavy responses to accurate answers. To improve fluency and accuracy when working with complex data, provide a function call hint immediately after the function call. These hints guide the model on the specific task—teaching it how to interpret key fields and domain-specific values.\n",

    "- Use conversational language.\n",
    "- Mention identical attributes once.\n",
    "- Ignore IDs and URLs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Player Details\n",
    "- State height conversationally (\"six-foot-eight\").\n",
    "- Round weights to nearest 5 lbs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stats & Draft Info\n",
    "- Round stats to nearest whole number.\n",
    "- Use general terms for draft ranking (\"top-five pick\").\n",
    "Experience\n",
    "- Refer to players as freshman, sophomore, etc., or mention professional experience.\n",
    "- Location & TeamMention hometown city and state/country.\n",
    "- Describe teams conversationally.\n",
