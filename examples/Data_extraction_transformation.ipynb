    "A lot of enterprise data is unstructured and locked up in difficult-to-use formats, e.g. PDFs, PPT, PNG, that are not optimized for use with LLMs or databases. As a result this type of data tends to be underutilized for analysis and product development, despite it being so valuable. The traditional way of extracting information from unstructured or non-ideal formats has been to use OCR, but OCR struggles with complex layouts and can have limited multilingual support. Moreover, manually applying transforms to data can be cumbersome and timeconsuming. \n",
