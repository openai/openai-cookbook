    "# Using file search tool in the Responses API\n",
    "\n",
    "Although RAG can be overwhelming, searching amongst PDF file shouldn't be complicated. One of the most adopted options as of now is parsing your PDF, defining your chunking strategies, uploading those chunks to a storage provider, running embeddings on those chunks of texts and storing those embeddings in a vector database. And that's only the setup — retrieving content in our LLM workflow also requires multiple steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where file search — a hosted tool you can use in the Responses API — comes in. It allows you to search your knowledge base and generate an answer based on the retrieved content. In this cookbook, we'll upload those PDFs to a vector store on OpenAI and use file search to fetch additional context from this vector store to answer the questions we generated in the first step. Then, we'll initially create a small set of questions based on PDFs extracted from OpenAI's blog ([openai.com/news](https://openai.com/news)).\n",
    "\n",
    "_File search was previously available on the Assistants API. It's now available on the new Responses API, an API that can be stateful or stateless, and with from new features like metadata filtering_\n",

      "1. **Autonomous Research**: Deep Research acts as an independent agent that synthesizes vast amounts of information across the web, enabling users to receive comprehensive reports similar to those produced by a research analyst.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Multi-Step Reasoning**: It performs deep analysis by finding, interpreting, and synthesizing data from various sources, including text, images, and PDFs.\n",

      "3. **Application Areas**: Especially useful for professionals in fields such as finance, science, policy, and engineering, as well as for consumers seeking detailed information for purchases.\n",

      "4. **Efficiency**: The output is fully documented with citations, making it easy to verify information, and it significantly speeds up research processes that would otherwise take hours for a human to complete.\n",
