    "arguments": {{
      "mode":"video",
      "duration":"fill_in_int"

COMMAND_GENERATION_PROMPT= """
You are to output 2 commands, questions or statements that would generate the inputted function and parameters.
Please make the commands or questions natural, as a person would ask, and the command or questions should be varied and not repetitive.
It should not always mirror the exact technical terminology used in the function and parameters, rather reflect a conversational and intuitive request.
For instance, the prompt should not be 'turn on the dome light', as that is too technical, but rather 'turn on the inside lights'.
Another example, is the prompt should not be 'turn on the HVAC', but rather 'turn on the air conditioning'. Use language a normal driver would use, even if
it is technically incorrect but colloquially used.

RULES: ALWAYS put a backwards slash before an apostrophe or single quote '. For example, do not say don't but say don\'t.
Prompts MUST be in double quotes as well.

Example

Input: {{'name': 'calibrate_sensors','arguments': {{}}'' }}
Prompt: ["The sensors are out of whack, can you reset them", "The calibration of the drone is off, fix it please!"]

Input: {{'name': 'set_autopilot','arguments': {{'status': 'off'}}}}
Prompt: ["OK, I want to take back pilot control now","Turn off the automatic pilot I'm ready control it"]

Input: {invocation}
Prompt:
