    "This notebook builds on the concepts in the [argument generation](How_to_call_functions_with_chat_models.ipynb) notebook, by creating an agent with access to a knowledge base and two functions that it can call based on the user requirement.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll create an agent that uses data from arXiv to answer questions about academic subjects. It has two functions at its disposal:\n",
    "- **get_articles**: A function that gets arXiv articles on a subject and summarizes them for the user with links.\n",
    "- **read_article_and_summarize**: This function takes one of the previously searched articles, reads it in its entirety and summarizes the core argument, evidence and conclusions.\n",

    "- **Configure Agent:** Building up the Agent behaviour that will assess the need for a function and, if one is required, call that function and present results back to the agent.\n",

       "- The paper argues that Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and its dynamic variant (PPO-dynamic) significantly improve sequence generation tasks, particularly for chit-chat chatbots, by addressing the instability and suboptimal performance associated with traditional policy gradient methods.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Evidence\n",
       "- **Challenges with Traditional Methods**: Traditional policy gradient methods, like REINFORCE, suffer from unstable training and poor performance due to large updates and similar action tendencies, especially in non-differentiable evaluation contexts (e.g., BLEU scores).\n",
       "- **PPO Advantages**: PPO regularizes policy updates, enhancing training stability and enabling the generation of coherent and diverse chatbot responses.\n",
       "- **Dynamic PPO Approach**: PPO-dynamic introduces adaptive constraints on KL-divergence, allowing for dynamic adjustments based on action probabilities, which leads to improved training performance.\n",
       "- **Experimental Validation**: The authors conducted experiments on synthetic counting tasks and real-world chit-chat scenarios, demonstrating that PPO and PPO-dynamic outperform traditional methods like REINFORCE and SeqGAN in terms of stability and performance metrics (e.g., BLEU-2 scores).\n",
       "- **Results**: PPO-dynamic showed faster convergence and higher precision in the counting task, and it achieved the best performance in the chit-chat task, indicating its effectiveness in generating diverse and contextually appropriate responses.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Conclusions\n",
       "- The introduction of PPO and PPO-dynamic enhances the training stability and output diversity in sequence generation tasks, making them more suitable for applications like chatbots.\n",
       "- The dynamic variant of PPO not only improves performance but also accelerates convergence, addressing the limitations of traditional policy gradient methods and providing a robust framework for reinforcement learning in sequence generation."

       "### Core Argument\n",
       "- The paper argues for the adoption of Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and its dynamic variant (PPO-dynamic) as superior methods for sequence generation tasks, particularly in the context of chit-chat chatbots, compared to traditional policy gradient methods.\n",
       "- It highlights the instability and suboptimal performance of traditional policy gradient methods, such as REINFORCE, and presents PPO as a more stable and efficient alternative.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Evidence\n",
       "- **Challenges with Policy Gradient**: Traditional methods lead to unstable training and poor performance due to large updates and similar action tendencies, especially in non-differentiable evaluation metrics like BLEU scores.\n",
       "- **PPO Advantages**: PPO regularizes policy updates, enhancing stability and coherence in chatbot responses.\n",
       "- **Dynamic PPO Approach**: PPO-dynamic introduces dynamic adjustments to the KL-divergence bounds, allowing for more flexible and effective training.\n",
       "- **Experimental Validation**: Experiments on synthetic tasks and real-world chit-chat scenarios demonstrate that PPO and PPO-dynamic outperform REINFORCE and other algorithms (like MIXER and SeqGAN) in terms of stability and performance metrics, including BLEU-2 scores.\n",
       "- **Results**: PPO-dynamic showed significant improvements in precision on counting tasks and achieved the highest BLEU-2 score for chatbot responses, indicating better performance in generating diverse and accurate outputs.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Conclusions\n",
       "- The paper concludes that replacing traditional policy gradient methods with PPO, particularly the dynamic version, leads to more stable training and faster convergence in sequence generation tasks.\n",
       "- The proposed PPO-dynamic method enhances the training process by dynamically adjusting constraints, resulting in improved performance and efficiency in generating human-like conversational agents.\n",
       "- Future research directions are suggested to further explore the potential of PPO and its adaptations in natural language processing applications."
