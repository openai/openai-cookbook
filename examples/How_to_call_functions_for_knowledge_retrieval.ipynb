    "\n",
    "This notebook builds on the concepts in the [argument generation](How_to_call_functions_with_chat_models.ipynb) notebook, by creating an agent with access to a knowledge base and two functions that it can call based on the user requirement.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll create an agent that uses data from arXiv to answer questions about academic subjects. It has two functions at its disposal:\n",
    "- **get_articles**: A function that gets arXiv articles on a subject and summarizes them for the user with links.\n",
    "- **read_article_and_summarize**: This function takes one of the previously searched articles, reads it in its entirety and summarizes the core argument, evidence and conclusions.\n",
    "\n",
    "This will get you comfortable with a multi-function workflow that can choose from multiple services, and where some of the data from the first function is persisted to be used by the second.\n",

    "This cookbook takes you through the following workflow:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Search utilities:** Creating the two functions that access arXiv for answers.\n",
    "- **Configure Agent:** Building up the Agent behaviour that will assess the need for a function and, if one is required, call that function and present results back to the agent.\n",
    "- **arXiv conversation:** Put all of this together in live conversation.\n"

In one spatial\\ndimension, we construct a frustration-free lattice model exhibiting SSB of a\\nnon-onsite symmetry, which features the coexistence of two ground states with\\ndistinct symmetry-protected topological (SPT) orders. We analytically prove the\\ntwo-fold ground-state degeneracy and the existence of a finite energy gap.\\nFixing the symmetry sector yields a long-range entangled ground state that\\nfeatures long-range correlations among non-invertible charged operators. We\\nalso present a constant-depth measurement-feedback protocol to prepare such a\\nstate with a constant success probability in the thermodynamic limit, which may\\nbe of independent interest. Under a symmetric deformation, the SSB persists up\\nto a critical point, beyond which a gapless phase characterized by a conformal\\nfield theory emerges. In two spatial dimensions, the SSB of 1-form non-onsite\\nsymmetries leads to a long-range entangled state (SPT soup) - a condensate of\\n1d SPT along any closed loops. On a torus, there are four such locally\\nindistinguishable states that exhibit algebraic correlations between local\\noperators, which we derived via a mapping to the critical $O(2)$ loop model.\\nThis provides an intriguing example of `topological quantum criticality'. Our\\nwork reveals the exotic features of SSB of non-onsite symmetries, which may lie\\nbeyond the framework of topological holography (SymTFT).\",\n",

      "- The paper presents a novel approach to quantum error correction (QEC) through the development of topological stabilizer codes based on continuous variable (CV) systems.\n",
      "- It introduces a family of two-dimensional topological stabilizer codes that leverage boson condensation, generalizing existing models and addressing limitations in current QEC codes.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Evidence\n",
      "- **Topological Stabilizer Codes**: The authors construct codes that utilize continuous variable degrees of freedom, extending models like homological rotor codes and the toric-GKP code.\n",
      "- **Boson Condensation**: The codes are derived from a parent stabilizer code based on Rgauge theory, demonstrating the creation of a broad class of topological CV stabilizer codes.\n",
      "- **Anyons and Theories**: The codes are characterized by anyon theories from U(1) 2n×U(1)−2m Chern-Simons theories, some of which are non-chiral and do not support gapped boundaries, indicating their unique properties.\n",
      "- **Hamiltonian Analysis**: The paper examines Hamiltonians associated with these codes, revealing that they can transition from a gapless to a gapped spectrum through quadratic perturbations.\n",
      "- **Scalability**: The research emphasizes the potential for scalable QEC codes that are intrinsic to CV systems, which is crucial for reducing logical error rates in complex quantum computations.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusions\n",
      "- The introduction of topological stabilizer codes based on continuous variables represents a significant advancement in the field of quantum error correction, providing a framework for developing fault-tolerant codes that can protect against logical errors.\n",
      "- The findings suggest that these codes may not be realizable through traditional concatenation methods, indicating the potential for new classes of QEC codes that are fundamentally different from existing finite-dimensional systems.\n",
      "- Future research directions include exploring many-body generalizations of quantum codes and the practical implementation of these theoretical models in experimental platforms, such as superconducting qubits.\n"

       "\n",
       "1. **Clipping Objective**: PPO modifies the objective function using a clipped surrogate objective. This avoids excessively large updates, which can destabilize training. The clipped objective restricts how much the probability ratio between the new and old policies can differ, allowing for better control over policy updates.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Policy Gradient**: PPO uses policy gradient methods, where the focus is on directly adjusting the policy based on the agent's performance after taking actions in the environment.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Multiple Epochs**: PPO often utilizes multiple epochs of training on the same batch of data, which improves sample efficiency as it allows the agent to learn from the same data multiple times.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE)**: To reduce the variance of the policy gradient estimates, PPO frequently employs GAE, which provides a more stable estimate of returns.\n",
