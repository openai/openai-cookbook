    "# How to Combine GPT-4o Mini with RAG - Create a Clothing Matchmaker App\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the Clothing Matchmaker App Jupyter Notebook! This project demonstrates the power of the GPT-4o mini model in analyzing images of clothing items and extracting key features such as color, style, and type. The core of our app relies on this advanced image analysis model developed by OpenAI, which enables us to accurately identify the characteristics of the input clothing item.\n",
    "\n",
    "GPT-4o mini is a small model that combines natural language processing with image recognition, allowing it to understand and generate responses based on both text and visual inputs with low latency.\n",
    "\n",
    "Building on the capabilities of the GPT-4o mini model, we employ a custom matching algorithm and the RAG technique to search our knowledge base for items that complement the identified features. This algorithm takes into account factors like color compatibility and style coherence to provide users with suitable recommendations. Through this notebook, we aim to showcase the practical application of these technologies in creating a clothing recommendation system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the combination of GPT-4o mini + RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) offers several advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Contextual Understanding**: GPT-4o mini can analyze input images and understand the context, such as the objects, scenes, and activities depicted. This allows for more accurate and relevant suggestions or information across various domains, whether it's interior design, cooking, or education.\n",
    "2. **Rich Knowledge Base**: RAG combines the generative capabilities of GPT-4 with a retrieval component that accesses a large corpus of information across different fields. This means the system can provide suggestions or insights based on a wide range of knowledge, from historical facts to scientific concepts.\n",
    "3. **Customization**: The approach allows for easy customization to cater to specific user needs or preferences in various applications. Whether it's tailoring suggestions to a user's taste in art or providing educational content based on a student's learning level, the system can be adapted to deliver personalized experiences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the GPT-4o mini + RAG approach offers a fast, powerful, and flexible solution for various fashion-related applications, leveraging the strengths of both generative and retrieval-based AI techniques.\n"

The analysis is performed through a straightforward API call, where we provide the URL of the image for analysis and request the model to identify relevant features.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Output Format Specification**: We instruct the model to return a JSON block with a predefined structure, consisting of:\n",
    "   - `items` (str[]): A list of strings, each representing a concise title for an item of clothing, including style, color, and gender. These titles closely resemble the `productDisplayName` property in our original database.\n",
    "   - `category` (str): The category that best represents the given item. The model selects from a list of all unique `articleTypes` present in the original styles dataframe.\n",
    "   - `gender` (str): A label indicating the gender the item is intended for. The model chooses from the options `[Men, Women, Boys, Girls, Unisex]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Clear and Concise Instructions**: \n",
    "   - We provide clear instructions on what the item titles should include and what the output format should be. The output should be in JSON format, but without the `json` tag that the model response normally contains.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **One Shot Example**: \n",
    "   - To further clarify the expected output, we provide the model with an example input description and a corresponding example output. Although this may increase the number of tokens used (and thus the cost of the call), it helps to guide the model and results in better overall performance.\n",

    "### Guardrails\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of using Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4o mini, \"guardrails\" refer to mechanisms or checks put in place to ensure that the model's output remains within desired parameters or boundaries. These guardrails are crucial for maintaining the quality and relevance of the model's responses, especially when dealing with complex or nuanced tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Guardrails are useful for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Accuracy**: They help ensure that the model's output is accurate and relevant to the input provided.\n",
    "2. **Consistency**: They maintain consistency in the model's responses, especially when dealing with similar or related inputs.\n",
    "3. **Safety**: They prevent the model from generating harmful, offensive, or inappropriate content.\n",
    "4. **Contextual Relevance**: They ensure that the model's output is contextually relevant to the specific task or domain it is being used for.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our case, we are using GPT-4o mini to analyze fashion images and suggest items that would complement an original outfit. To implement guardrails, we can **refine results**: After obtaining initial suggestions from GPT-4o mini, we can send the original image and the suggested items back to the model. We can then ask GPT-4o mini to evaluate whether each suggested item would indeed be a good fit for the original outfit.\n",
    "\n",
    "This gives the model the ability to self-correct and adjust its own output based on feedback or additional information. By implementing these guardrails and enabling self-correction, we can enhance the reliability and usefulness of the model's output in the context of fashion analysis and recommendation.\n",
    "\n",
    "To facilitate this, we write a prompt that asks the LLM for a simple \"yes\" or \"no\" answer to the question of whether the suggested items match the original outfit or not. This binary response helps streamline the refinement process and ensures clear and actionable feedback from the model."

    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this Jupyter Notebook, we explored the application of GPT-4o mini and other machine learning techniques to the domain of fashion. We demonstrated how to analyze images of clothing items, extract relevant features, and use this information to find matching items that complement an original outfit. Through the implementation of guardrails and self-correction mechanisms, we refined the model's suggestions to ensure they are accurate and contextually relevant.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach has several practical uses in the real world, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Personalized Shopping Assistants**: Retailers can use this technology to offer personalized outfit recommendations to customers, enhancing the shopping experience and increasing customer satisfaction.\n",
    "2. **Virtual Wardrobe Applications**: Users can upload images of their own clothing items to create a virtual wardrobe and receive suggestions for new items that match their existing pieces.\n",
    "3. **Fashion Design and Styling**: Fashion designers and stylists can use this tool to experiment with different combinations and styles, streamlining the creative process.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, one of the considerations to keep in mind is **cost**. The use of LLMs and image analysis models can incur costs, especially if used extensively. It's important to consider the cost-effectiveness of implementing these technologies. `gpt-4o-mini` is priced at `$0.01` per 1000 tokens. This adds up to `$0.00255` for one 256px x 256px image.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, this notebook serves as a foundation for further exploration and development in the intersection of fashion and AI, opening doors to more personalized and intelligent fashion recommendation systems."
