    "# How to handle rate limits\n",
    "\n",
    "When you call the OpenAI API repeatedly, you may encounter error messages that say `429: 'Too Many Requests'` or `RateLimitError`. These error messages come from exceeding the API's rate limits.\n",
    "\n",
    "This guide shares tips for avoiding and handling rate limit errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "To see an example script for throttling parallel requests to avoid rate limit errors, see [api_request_parallel_processor.py](https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook/blob/main/examples/api_request_parallel_processor.py).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why rate limits exist\n",
    "\n",
    "Rate limits are a common practice for APIs, and they're put in place for a few different reasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "- First, they help protect against abuse or misuse of the API. For example, a malicious actor could flood the API with requests in an attempt to overload it or cause disruptions in service. By setting rate limits, OpenAI can prevent this kind of activity.\n",
    "- Second, rate limits help ensure that everyone has fair access to the API. If one person or organization makes an excessive number of requests, it could bog down the API for everyone else. By throttling the number of requests that a single user can make, OpenAI ensures that everyone has an opportunity to use the API without experiencing slowdowns.\n",
    "- Lastly, rate limits can help OpenAI manage the aggregate load on its infrastructure. If requests to the API increase dramatically, it could tax the servers and cause performance issues. By setting rate limits, OpenAI can help maintain a smooth and consistent experience for all users.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although hitting rate limits can be frustrating, rate limits exist to protect the reliable operation of the API for its users."

    "## How to mitigate rate limit errors\n",
    "\n",
    "### Retrying with exponential backoff\n",
    "\n",
    "One easy way to mitigate rate limit errors is to automatically retry requests with a random exponential backoff. Retrying with exponential backoff means performing a short sleep when a rate limit error is hit, then retrying the unsuccessful request. If the request is still unsuccessful, the sleep length is increased and the process is repeated. This continues until the request is successful or until a maximum number of retries is reached.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach has many benefits:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Automatic retries means you can recover from rate limit errors without crashes or missing data\n",
    "- Exponential backoff means that your first retries can be tried quickly, while still benefiting from longer delays if your first few retries fail\n",
    "- Adding random jitter to the delay helps retries from all hitting at the same time\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that unsuccessful requests contribute to your per-minute limit, so continuously resending a request wonâ€™t work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below are a few example solutions."

Lily was known for her bright smile and infectious laughter, bringing joy to everyone around her.\\n\\nOne sunny morning, as Lily played in the meadows, she stumbled upon a mysterious book tucked away beneath a tall oak tree. Intrigued, she picked it up and dusted off its weathered cover to reveal intricate golden patterns. Without hesitation, she opened it, discovering that its pages were filled with magical tales and enchanting adventures.\\n\\nAmong the stories she found, one particularly caught her attentionâ€”a tale of a long-lost treasure hidden deep within a mysterious forest. Legend had it that whoever found this hidden treasure would be granted one wish, no matter how big or small. Excited by the prospect of finding such treasure and fulfilling her wildest dreams, Lily decided to embark on a thrilling journey to the forest.\\n\\nGathering her courage, Lily told her parents about the magical book and her quest to find the hidden treasure. Though concerned for their daughter\\'s safety, they couldn\\'t help but admire her spirit and determination. They hugged her tightly and blessed her with love and luck, promising to await her return.\\n\\nEquipped with a map she found within the book, Lily ventured into the depths of the thick forest. The trees whispered tales of forgotten secrets, and the enchanted creatures hidden within watched her every step. But Lily remained undeterred, driven by her desire to discover what lay ahead.\\n\\nDays turned into weeks as Lily traversed through dense foliage, crossed swift rivers, and climbed treacherous mountains. She encountered mystical beings who offered guidance and protection along her perilous journey. With their help, she overcame countless obstacles and grew braver with each passing day.\\n\\nFinally, after what felt like an eternity, Lily reached the heart of the forest. There, beneath a jeweled waterfall, she found the long-lost treasureâ€”a magnificent chest adorned with sparkling gemstones. Overwhelmed with excitement, she gently opened the chest to reveal a brilliant light that illuminated the forest.\\n\\nWithin the glow, a wise voice echoed, \"You have proven your courage and pure heart, young Lily. Make your wish, and it shall be granted.\"\\n\\nLily thought deeply about her wish, realizing that her true treasure was the love and happiness she felt in her heart. Instead of making a wish for herself, she asked for the wellbeing and prosperity of her village, spreading joy and harmony to everyone living there.\\n\\nAs the light faded, Lily knew her quest was complete. She retraced her steps through the forest, returning home to find her village flourishing. Fields bloomed with vibrant flowers, and laughter filled the air.\\n\\nThe villagers greeted Lily with open arms, recognizing her selflessness and the magic she had brought into their lives. From that day forward, they told the tale of Lily\\'s journey, celebrating her as a heroine who embodied the power of love, kindness, and the belief that true treasure lies within oneself.\\n\\nAnd so, the story of Lily became an everlasting legend, inspiring generations to follow their dreams, be selfless, and find the true treasures that lie within their hearts.', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1701010806, model='gpt-3.5-turbo-0613', object='chat.completion', system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=641, prompt_tokens=12, total_tokens=653))"

Elara had a curious spirit and a heart full of dreams. Every day, she would explore the woods surrounding her home, searching for hidden treasures and magical creatures.\\n\\nOne sunny afternoon, while wandering deeper into the forest than she ever had before, Elara stumbled upon a sparkling, crystal-clear pond. As she knelt down to take a closer look, she noticed a glimmering object at the bottom. It was a beautifully crafted key, shining with an otherworldly light. Without thinking twice, Elara reached into the cool water and retrieved the key, feeling a strange warmth envelop her.\\n\\nLittle did she know, this key was no ordinary key. It was said to unlock a secret door hidden in the heart of the forest, a door that led to a realm of wonder and adventure. Legends whispered of enchanted beings, ancient wisdom, and challenges that could only be overcome through bravery and kindness.\\n\\nExcited by the possibility of what awaited her, Elara set off on a quest to find the hidden door. Guided by a faint glow that seemed to beckon her, she journeyed through twisting pathways, lush groves, and enchanted glades.\\n\\nAlong the way, she encountered talking animals, wise old trees, and mischievous fairies, each offering clues and riddles that tested her resolve and imagination. With each challenge she faced, Elara grew stronger and more confident, realizing that the true magic lay not just in the world around her, but within herself.\\n\\nAfter what felt like days of exploring, she finally found the doorâ€”a majestic archway covered in vines and blossoms, with a keyhole that sparkled like the night sky. Heart pounding with excitement, Elara inserted the key. With a gentle turn, the door slowly creaked open, revealing a land more breathtaking than she could have ever imagined.\\n\\nAs she stepped through the doorway, she found herself in a vibrant world filled with colors beyond description, where the sky shimmered in hues of gold and lavender, and the air was filled with the sweet scent of flowers that sang as they swayed in the breeze. Here, she encountered beings of light who welcomed her with open arms.\\n\\nBut soon, she discovered that this realm was in peril. A dark shadow loomed over the land, threatening to steal its magic and joy. Elara knew she couldnâ€™t stand by and do nothing. With the friends she had made along her journey and the courage she had found within herself, she set out to confront the darkness.\\n\\nThrough trials that tested her strength, intellect, and compassion, Elara and her friends gathered the forgotten magic of the realm. They united their powers, confronting the shadow in an epic battle of light and dark. In the end, it was Elara's unwavering belief in hope and friendship that banished the darkness, restoring peace and harmony to the land.\\n\\nGrateful for her bravery, the beings of light gifted Elara a shimmering pendant that would allow her to return to their world whenever she wished, reminding her that true magic lies in the connections we forge with others and the courage to follow our dreams.\\n\\nWith her heart full of joy, Elara returned to her village, forever changed by her adventure. She would often revisit the magical realm, sharing stories with her friends and inspiring them to embrace their own dreams. And so, the girl who once wandered the woods became a beacon of hope, a reminder that within every heart lies the power to change the world.\\n\\nAnd from that day on, the little village thrived, full of laughter, love, and dreams waiting to be exploredâ€”each adventure beginning just like hers, with a curious heart and a willingness to believe in the impossible. \\n\\nThe end.\", refusal=None, role='assistant', audio=None, function_call=None, tool_calls=None), internal_metrics=[{'cached_prompt_tokens': 0, 'total_accepted_tokens': 0, 'total_batched_tokens': 794, 'total_predicted_tokens': 0, 'total_rejected_tokens': 0, 'total_tokens_in_completion': 795, 'cached_embeddings_bytes': 0, 'cached_embeddings_n': 0, 'uncached_embeddings_bytes': 0, 'uncached_embeddings_n': 0, 'fetched_embeddings_bytes': 0, 'fetched_embeddings_n': 0, 'n_evictions': 0, 'sampling_steps': 767, 'sampling_steps_with_predictions': 0, 'batcher_ttft': 0.20319080352783203, 'batcher_initial_queue_time': 0.12981152534484863}])], created=1737062945, model='gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18', object='chat.completion', service_tier='default', system_fingerprint='fp_72ed7ab54c', usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=767, prompt_tokens=12, total_tokens=779, completion_tokens_details=CompletionTokensDetails(accepted_prediction_tokens=0, audio_tokens=0, reasoning_tokens=0, rejected_prediction_tokens=0), prompt_tokens_details=PromptTokensDetails(audio_tokens=0, cached_tokens=0, cached_tokens_internal=0)))"

Intrigued, she dusted it off and inspected it closely. The key was beautifully crafted, with intricate patterns carved into its metal.

    "\n",
    "However, if you're processing large volumes of batch data, where throughput matters more than latency, there are a few other things you can do in addition to backoff and retry.\n",

    "### Proactively adding delay between requests\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are constantly hitting the rate limit, then backing off, then hitting the rate limit again, then backing off again, it's possible that a good fraction of your request budget will be 'wasted' on requests that need to be retried. This limits your processing throughput, given a fixed rate limit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, one potential solution is to calculate your rate limit and add a delay equal to its reciprocal (e.g., if your rate limit 20 requests per minute, add a delay of 3â€“6 seconds to each request).

    "### Batching requests\n",
    "\n",
    "The OpenAI API enforces separate limits for requests per minute/day (RPM/RPD) and tokens per minute (TPM). If youâ€™re hitting RPM limits but still have available TPM capacity, consider batching multiple tasks into each request.\n",
    "\n",
    "By bundling several prompts together, you reduce the total number of requests sent per minute, which helps avoid hitting the RPM cap. This approach may also lead to higher overall throughput if you manage your TPM usage carefully. However, keep the following points in mind:\n",
    "- Each model has a maximum number of tokens it can process in one request. If your batched prompt exceeds this limit, the request will fail or be truncated.\n",
    "- Batching can introduce extra waiting time if tasks are delayed until theyâ€™re grouped into a single request. This might affect user experience for time-sensitive applications.\n",
    "- When sending multiple prompts, the response object may not return in the same order or format as the prompts that were submitted. You should try to match each response back to its corresponding prompt by post-processing the output.\n",
