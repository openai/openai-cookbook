    "# How to use image moderation\n",
    "\n",
    "This Python script demonstrates how to use OpenAI's Moderation API to analyze image URLs for compliance with moderation policies. The example includes two key functions: one for checking individual image URLs (`check_image_moderation`) and another for batch processing multiple URLs (`batch_process_image_urls`). The script not only identifies whether an image is approved for upload but also provides detailed feedback on flagged categories, helping users understand why an image may not meet the criteria. Additionally, the batch processing results are displayed in a neatly formatted table for better readability, making this tool practical for reviewing multiple images efficiently. For more information about using the Moderation API for images, visit the [OpenAI Moderation Guide](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/moderation?example=images).\n",
    "\n",
    "To try out this example, first install the dependencies `openai`, `pandas`, `tabulate` and then modify the `image_urls` as necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "This API can be incredibly useful in a variety of real-world scenarios where content moderation is critical. For instance, social media platforms can use it to automatically screen user-uploaded images for harmful or inappropriate content, ensuring compliance with community guidelines. E-commerce platforms could utilize it to prevent the listing of prohibited or counterfeit items. Additionally, educational platforms and online forums can leverage this tool to maintain a safe and respectful environment by filtering out offensive imagery. Organizations handling large volumes of user-generated content, such as news agencies or content-sharing platforms, can use the batch processing feature to efficiently review multiple images at once, saving time while promoting ethical and responsible content dissemination. This solution not only aids in regulatory compliance but also helps foster trust and safety in digital communities.\n",
