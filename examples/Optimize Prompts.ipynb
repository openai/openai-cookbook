    "## 1. System Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The prompt optimization system uses a collaborative multi-agent approach to analyze and improve prompts. Each agent specializes in either detecting or rewriting a specific type of issue:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Dev-Contradiction-Checker**: Scans the prompt for logical contradictions or impossible instructions, like \"only use positive numbers\" and \"include negative examples\" in the same prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Format-Checker**: Identifies when a prompt expects structured output (like JSON, CSV, or Markdown) but fails to clearly specify the exact format requirements. This agent ensures that all necessary fields, data types, and formatting rules are explicitly defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Few-Shot-Consistency-Checker**: Examines example conversations to ensure that the assistant's responses actually follow the rules specified in the prompt. This catches mismatches between what the prompt requires and what the examples demonstrate.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Dev-Rewriter**: After issues are identified, this agent rewrites the prompt to resolve contradictions and clarify format specifications while preserving the original intent.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Few-Shot-Rewriter**: Updates inconsistent example responses to align with the rules in the prompt, ensuring all examples properly comply with the new developer prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "By working together, these agents can systematically identify and fix issues in prompts."

    "## 3. Defining the Agents\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we create specialized AI agents using the `Agent` class from the `openai-agents` package. Looking at these agent definitions reveals several best practices for creating effective AI instructions:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Best Practices in Agent Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Clear Scope Definition**: Each agent has a narrowly defined purpose with explicit boundaries. For example, the contradiction checker focuses only on \"genuine self-contradictions\" and explicitly states that \"overlaps or redundancies are not contradictions.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Step-by-Step Process**: Instructions provide a clear methodology, like how the format checker first categorizes the task before analyzing format requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Explicit Definitions**: Key terms are defined precisely to avoid ambiguity. The few-shot consistency checker includes a detailed \"Compliance Rubric\" explaining exactly what constitutes compliance.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Boundary Setting**: Instructions specify what the agent should NOT do. The few-shot checker explicitly lists what's \"Out-of-scope\" to prevent over-flagging issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Structured Output Requirements**: Each agent has a strictly defined output format with examples, ensuring consistency in the optimization pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "These principles create reliable, focused agents that work effectively together in the optimization system. Below we see the complete agent definitions with their detailed instructions."

    "From these 20 hand labelled golden outputs which cover a range of contradiction issues, few shot issues, format issues, no issues, or a combination of issues, we built a python string check grader to verify two things: whether an issue was detected for each golden pair and whether the detected issue matched the expected one. From this signal, we tuned the agent instructions and which model to use to maximize our accuracy across this evaluation. We landed on the 4.1 model as a balance between accuracy, cost, and speed. The specific prompts we used also follow the 4.1 prompting guide. As you can see, we achieve the correct labels on all 20 golden outputs: identifying the right issues and avoiding false positives. "
