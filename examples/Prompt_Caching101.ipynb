    "OpenAI offers discounted prompt caching for prompts exceeding 1024 tokens, resulting in up to an 80% reduction in latency for longer prompts over 10,000 tokens. By caching repetitive information across LLM API requests, you can greatly reduce both latency and costs. Prompt caching is scoped at the organization level, meaning only members of the same organization can access shared caches. Additionally, caching is eligible for zero data retention, as no data is stored during the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prompt caching automatically activates for prompts longer than 1024 tokens-- you don't have to change anything in your completions request. When an API request is made, the system first checks if the beginning portion (prefix) of the prompt has already been cached. If a match is found (cache hit), the cached prompt is used, leading to reduced latency and costs. If there's no match, the system processes the full prompt from scratch and caches the prefix for future use.\n",
    "\n",
    "With these benefits in mind, some of the key use cases where prompt caching can be especially advantageous are:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Agents using tools and structured outputs**: Cache the extended list of tools and schemas.  \n",
    "- **Coding and writing assistants**: Insert large sections or summaries of codebases and workspaces directly in prompts. \n",
    "- **Chatbots**: Cache static portions of multi-turn conversations to maintain context efficiently over extended dialogues.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this cookbook, we'll go through a couple examples of caching tools and images. Recall that in general, you'll want to put static content like instructions and examples at the beginning of your prompt, and variable content, such as user-specific information, at the end. This also applies to images and tools, which must be identical even in their ordering between requests. All requests, including those with fewer than 1024 tokens, will display a cached_tokens field of the `usage.prompt_tokens_details` chat completions object indicating how many of the prompt tokens were a cache hit. For requests under 1024 tokens, cached_tokens will be zero. Caching discounts are based on the actual number of tokens processed, including those used for images, which also count toward your rate limits."

    "## Example 1: Caching tools and multi-turn conversations\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we define tools and interactions for a customer support assistant, capable of handling tasks such as checking delivery dates, canceling orders, and updating payment methods. The assistant processes two separate messages, first responding to an initial query, followed by a delayed response to a follow-up query.\n",
    "\n",
    "When caching tools, it is important that the tool definitions and their order remain identical for them to be included in the prompt prefix. To cache message histories in a multi-turn conversation, append new elements to the end of the messages array. In the response object and the output below, for the second completion `run2`, you can see that the `cached_tokens` value is greater than zero, indicating successful caching."

When handling personal details such as order IDs, addresses, or payment methods, ensure that the information is treated with the highest confidentiality. If a user requests access to their data, only provide the necessary information relevant to their request, ensuring no other user's information is accidentally revealed.\"\n",
    "            \"\\n\\n\"\n",
    "            \"2. **Secure Payment Handling**: When updating payment details or processing refunds, always ensure that payment data such as credit card numbers, CVVs, and expiration dates are transmitted and stored securely. Never display or log full credit card numbers. Confirm with the user before processing any payment changes or refunds.\"\n",
    "            \"\\n\\n\"\n",
    "            \"3. **Respect Boundaries**: If a user expresses frustration or dissatisfaction, remain calm and empathetic but avoid overstepping professional boundaries. Do not make personal judgments, and refrain from using language that might escalate the situation. Stick to factual information and clear solutions to resolve the user's concerns.\"\n",
    "            \"\\n\\n\"\n",
    "            \"4. **Legal Compliance**: Ensure that all actions you take comply with legal and regulatory standards. For example, if the user requests a refund, cancellation, or return, follow the company’s refund policies strictly. If the order cannot be canceled due to being shipped or another restriction, explain the policy clearly but sympathetically.\"\n",
    "            \"\\n\\n\"\n",
    "            \"5. **Consistency**: Always provide consistent information that aligns with company policies. If unsure about a company policy, communicate clearly with the user, letting them know that you are verifying the information, and avoid providing false promises. If escalating an issue to another team, inform the user and provide a realistic timeline for when they can expect a resolution.\"\n",

Provide them with relevant options and explain each clearly, ensuring that they understand the consequences of each choice (e.g., canceling an order may result in loss of loyalty points, etc.). Ensure that your assistance supports their autonomy.\"\n",
    "            \"\\n\\n\"\n",
    "            \"7. **No Speculative Information**: Do not speculate about outcomes or provide information that you are not certain of. Always stick to verified facts when discussing order statuses, policies, or potential resolutions. If something is unclear, tell the user you will investigate further before making any commitments.\"\n",
    "            \"\\n\\n\"\n",

    "\n",
    "To get the most out of prompt caching, consider following these best practices:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Place static or frequently reused content at the beginning of prompts: This helps ensure better cache efficiency by keeping dynamic data towards the end of the prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "-  Maintain consistent usage patterns: Prompts that aren't used regularly are automatically removed from the cache. To prevent cache evictions, maintain consistent usage of prompts.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Monitor key metrics: Regularly track cache hit rates, latency, and the proportion of cached tokens. Use these insights to fine-tune your caching strategy and maximize performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "By implementing these practices, you can take full advantage of prompt caching, ensuring that your applications are both responsive and cost-efficient. A well-managed caching strategy will significantly reduce processing times, lower costs, and help maintain smooth user experiences."
