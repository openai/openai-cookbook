    "# Question answering using embeddings-based search\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "What should you do if you want GPT to answer questions about unfamiliar topics? E.g.,\n",
    "- Recent events after October 2023 for GPT 4 series models\n",
    "- Your non-public documents\n",

    "- etc.\n",

    "## Why search is better than fine-tuning\n",
    "\n",
    "GPT can learn knowledge in two ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Via model weights (i.e., fine-tune the model on a training set)\n",
    "- Via model inputs (i.e., insert the knowledge into an input message)\n",
    "\n",
    "Although fine-tuning can feel like the more natural option—training on data is how GPT learned all of its other knowledge, after all—we generally do not recommend it as a way to teach the model knowledge. Fine-tuning is better suited to teaching specialized tasks or styles, and is less reliable for factual recall.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an analogy, model weights are like long-term memory. When you fine-tune a model, it's like studying for an exam a week away. When the exam arrives, the model may forget details, or misremember facts it never read.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, message inputs are like short-term memory. When you insert knowledge into a message, it's like taking an exam with open notes. With notes in hand, the model is more likely to arrive at correct answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "One downside of text search relative to fine-tuning is that each model is limited by a maximum amount of text it can read at once:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Model           | Maximum text length       |\n",
    "|-----------------|---------------------------|\n",
    "| `gpt-4o-mini`   | 128,000 tokens (~384 pages)|\n",
    "| `gpt-4o`        | 128,000 tokens (~384 pages)|\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Continuing the analogy, you can think of the model like a student who can only look at a few pages of notes at a time, despite potentially having shelves of textbooks to draw upon.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, to build a system capable of drawing upon large quantities of text to answer questions, we recommend using a Search-Ask approach.\n"

    "## Search\n",
    "\n",
    "Text can be searched in many ways. E.g.,\n",
    "\n",
    "- Lexical-based search\n",
    "- Graph-based search\n",
    "- Embedding-based search\n",
    "\n",
    "This example notebook uses embedding-based search. [Embeddings](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings) are simple to implement and work especially well with questions, as questions often don't lexically overlap with their answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider embeddings-only search as a starting point for your own system. Better search systems might combine multiple search methods, along with features like popularity, recency, user history, redundancy with prior search results, click rate data, etc. Q&A retrieval performance may also be improved with techniques like [HyDE](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10496), in which questions are first transformed into hypothetical answers before being embedded. Similarly, GPT can also potentially improve search results by automatically transforming questions into sets of keywords or search terms."

    "## Full procedure\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, this notebook demonstrates the following procedure:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Prepare search data (once per document)\n",
    "    1. Collect: We'll download a few hundred Wikipedia articles about the 2022 Olympics\n",
    "    2. Chunk: Documents are split into short, mostly self-contained sections to be embedded\n",
    "    3. Embed: Each section is embedded with the OpenAI API\n",
    "    4. Store: Embeddings are saved (for large datasets, use a vector database)\n",
    "2. Search (once per query)\n",
    "    1. Given a user question, generate an embedding for the query from the OpenAI API\n",
    "    2. Using the embeddings, rank the text sections by relevance to the query\n",
    "3. Ask (once per query)\n",
    "    1. Insert the question and the most relevant sections into a message to GPT\n",
    "    2. Return GPT's answer\n",
    "\n",
    "### Costs\n",
    "\n",
    "Because GPT models are more expensive than embeddings search, a system with a decent volume of queries will have its costs dominated by step 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "- For `gpt-4o`, considering ~1000 tokens per query, it costs ~$0.0025 per query, or ~450 queries per dollar (as of Nov 2024)\n",
    "- For `gpt-4o-mini`, using ~1000 tokens per query, it costs ~$0.00015 per query, or ~6000 queries per dollar (as of Nov 2024)\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, exact costs will depend on the system specifics and usage patterns."

Paris was the host city, with events (mainly football) held in 16 additional cities spread across metropolitan France, including the sailing centre in the second-largest city of France, Marseille, on the Mediterranean Sea, as well as one subsite for surfing in Tahiti, French Polynesia.[4]\n",

After multiple withdrawals that left only Paris and Los Angeles in contention, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) approved a process to concurrently award the 2024 and 2028 Summer Olympics to the two remaining candidate cities; both bids were praised for their high technical plans and innovative ways to use a record-breaking number of existing and temporary facilities. Having previously hosted in 1900 and 1924, Paris became the second city ever to host the Summer Olympics three times (after London, which hosted the games in 1908, 1948, and 2012).[5][6] Paris 2024 marked the centenary of Paris 1924 and Chamonix 1924 (the first Winter Olympics), as well as the sixth Olympic Games hosted by France (three Summer Olympics and three Winter Olympics) and the first with this distinction since the 1992 Winter Games in Albertville. The Summer Games returned to the traditional four-year Olympiad cycle, after the 2020 edition was postponed to 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n",

In April 2024, after Islamic State claimed responsibility for the Crocus City Hall attack in March, and made several threats against the UEFA Champions League quarter-finals, French president Emmanuel Macron indicated that the opening ceremony could be scaled back or re-located if necessary.[91][92][93] French authorities had placed roughly 75,000 police and military officials on the streets of Paris in the lead-up to the Games.[94]\n",

       "\"COVID-19 had a significant impact on the 2022 Winter Olympics in several ways:\\n\\n1. **Qualification Changes**: The pandemic led to changes in the qualification process for sports like curling and women's ice hockey due to the cancellation of tournaments in 2020. Qualification for curling was based on placement in the 2021 World Curling Championships and an Olympic Qualification Event, while the IIHF used existing world rankings for women's ice hockey.\\n\\n2. **Biosecurity Protocols**: The IOC announced strict biosecurity protocols, requiring all athletes to remain within a bio-secure bubble, undergo daily COVID-19 testing, and only travel to and from Games-related venues. Athletes who were not fully vaccinated or did not have a valid medical exemption had to quarantine for 21 days upon arrival.\\n\\n3. **Spectator Restrictions**: Initially, only residents of the People's Republic of China were allowed to attend as spectators. Later, ticket sales to the general public were canceled, and only limited numbers of spectators were admitted by invitation, making it the second consecutive Olympics closed to the general public.\\n\\n4. **NHL Withdrawal**: The National Hockey League (NHL) withdrew its players from the men's hockey tournament due to COVID-19 concerns and the need to make up postponed games.\\n\\n5. **Quarantine and Testing**: Everyone present at the Games had to use the My2022 mobile app for health reporting and COVID-19 testing records. Concerns about the app's security led some delegations to advise athletes to use burner phones and laptops.\\n\\n6. **Athlete Absences**: Some top athletes, considered medal contenders, were unable to travel to China after testing positive for COVID-19, even if asymptomatic. This included athletes like Austrian ski jumper Marita Kramer and Russian skeletonist Nikita Tregubov.\\n\\n7. **Complaints and Controversies**: There were complaints from athletes and team officials about quarantine conditions, including issues with food, facilities, and lack of training equipment. Some athletes expressed frustration over the testing process and quarantine management.\\n\\n8. **COVID-19 Cases**: A total of 437 COVID-19 cases were reported during the Olympics, with 171 cases among the protective bubble residents and 266 detected from airport testing. Despite strict containment efforts, the number of cases was only slightly lower than those reported during the 2020 Tokyo Summer Olympics.\\n\\nOverall, COVID-19 significantly influenced the organization, participation, and experience of the 2022 Winter Olympics.\""
