    "This notebook shows how to use LLMs in combination with [Neo4j](https://neo4j.com/), a graph database, to perform Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why use RAG?\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to use LLMs to generate answers based on your own content or knowledge base, instead of providing large context when prompting the model, you can fetch the relevant information in a database and use this information to generate a response. \n",
    "\n",
    "This allows you to:\n",
    "- Reduce hallucinations\n",
    "- Provide relevant, up to date information to your users\n",
    "- Leverage your own content/knowledge base\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why use a graph database?\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have data where relationships between data points are important and you might want to leverage that, then it might be worth considering graph databases instead of traditional relational databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Graph databases are good to address the following:\n",
    "- Navigating deep hierarchies\n",
    "- Finding hidden connections between items\n",
    "- Discovering relationships between items\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use cases \n",
    "\n",
    "Graph databases are particularly relevant for recommendation systems, network relationships or analysing correlation between data points.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Example use cases for RAG with graph databases include:\n",
    "- Recommendation chatbot\n",
    "- AI-augmented CRM \n",
    "- Tool to analyse customer behavior with natural language\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on your use case, you can assess whether using a graph database makes sense. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will build a **product recommendation chatbot**, with a graph database that contains Amazon products data.\n"

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "### User experience\n",
    "\n",
    "When the primary objective is to extract specific information from our database, Large Language Models (LLMs) can significantly enhance our querying capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it's crucial to base much of this process on robust code logic to ensure a foolproof user experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "For crafting a genuinely conversational chatbot, further exploration in prompt engineering is necessary, possibly incorporating few-shot examples. This approach helps mitigate the risk of generating inaccurate or misleading information and ensures more precise responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately, the design choice depends on the desired user experience. For instance, if the aim is to create a visual recommendation system, the importance of a conversational interface is less relevant.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Working with a knowledge graph \n",
    "\n",
    "Retrieving content from a knowledge graph adds complexity but can be useful if you want to leverage connections between items. \n",
    "\n",
    "The querying part of this notebook would work on a relational database as well, the knowledge graph comes in handy when we want to couple the results with similar items that the graph is surfacing. \n",
    "\n",
    "Considering the added complexity, make sure using a knowledge graph is the best option for your use case.\n",
    "If it is the case, feel free to refine what this cookbook presents to match your needs and perform even better!"
