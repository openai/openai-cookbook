    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Evals are what turn a voice demo into something people can rely on. The gap between “seems fine” and “works every day” is almost always evals.\n",
    "\n",
    "This guide shows how to evaluate voice systems by slowly building complexity: start simple (Crawl), add realism (Walk), then test multi-turn (Run). Along the way, you’ll learn to build the three things that make results robust: a dataset, graders, and an eval harness, plus a production flywheel so real failures become new tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "Teams that invest in evals can ship to production 5–10× faster because they can see what’s failing, pinpoint why, and fix it with confidence.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part I: Foundations\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1) Why realtime evals are hard\n",
    "\n",
    "Realtime is harder than text because you are grading a **streaming interaction** with two outputs: what the **assistant doe**s and **how it sounds**. A response can be “right” and still sound broken.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.1 The 2 axes of realtime quality\n",
    "\n",
    "Text evals mostly ask if the content is right. Realtime adds a second axis: audio quality. Content and audio can fail independently, so a single score can hide real problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Most realtime evals can reduce to two independent axes:**"

   "source": [
    "1. Content quality: Did the assistant understand the user and do the right thing? Correctness, helpfulness, tool choice, tool arguments, and instruction following.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Audio quality: Did the assistant sound acceptable? Naturalness, prosody, pronunciation, stability, and how it behaves under noise and imperfect capture.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.2 Hard to debug\n",
    "\n",
    "With the **Responses API**, the mental model is simple: **request in → response out**. With the **Realtime API**, a “turn” is a s**titched pipeline**. That orchestration makes voice apps easy to build, but for evals, you must log stages so you can isolate failures and find root causes."

    "\n",
    "#### 4.2 Build for iteration, not just volume\n",
    "\n",
    "Eval datasets exist to drive iteration, not to look big. The loop is the product: **run evals → localize failures to a specific behavior → change one thing → re-run → confirm the fix improved without regressions**. A benchmark is “good” if it makes that loop fast, repeatable, and easy to diagnose.\n",
    "\n",
    "That requires coverage, not raw count: you need to represent the actual user behaviors and the specific edge cases that cause production failures. Size alone won’t surface fragility; the right coverage will. \n",

    "**Customer Example:** A team built a voice support bot and optimized hard for the “escalate_to_human” tool call. Their offline score hit 98 percent on escalation. In dogfooding, the bot started escalating for almost everything. The root cause was dataset imbalance. They had many “must escalate” cases and almost no “do not escalate” cases, so the model learned a shortcut: escalate whenever uncertain. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, you must precisely tag your data to enable fine-grain evaluations. These tags should provide the necessary detail to move from a general observation, like \"score dropped,\" to a specific root cause, such **as \"this intent fails under these audio conditions with this policy boundary.\" Example of tags could be:** intent, expected outcome, audio condition, language, and expected tool call. Tagged data enables teams to run fine-grain evaluations leading to faster iteration loops."
