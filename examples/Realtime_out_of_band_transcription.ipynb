        "# Transcribing User Audio with a Separate Realtime Request\n",
        "\n",
        "**Purpose**: This notebook demonstrates how to use the Realtime model itself to accurately transcribe user audio `out-of-band` using the same websocket session connection, avoiding errors and inconsistencies common when relying on a separate transcription model (gpt-4o-transcribe/whisper-1).\n",
        "\n",
        "We call this [out-of-band](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/realtime-conversations#create-responses-outside-the-default-conversation) transcription using the Realtime model. It’s simply a second response.create request on the same Realtime WebSocket, tagged so it doesn’t write back to the active conversation state. The model runs again with a different set of instructions (a transcription prompt), triggering a new inference pass that’s separate from the assistant’s main speech turn.\n",
        "\n",
        "It covers how to build a server-to-server client that:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Streams microphone audio to an OpenAI Realtime voice agent.\n",
        "- Plays back the agent's spoken replies.\n",
        "- After each user turn, generates a high-quality text-only transcript using the **same Realtime model**.\n",

        "# 1. Why use out-of-band transcription?\n",
        "\n",
        "The Realtime API offers built-in user input transcription, but this relies on a **separate ASR model** (e.g., gpt-4o-transcribe). Using different models for transcription and response generation can lead to discrepancies. For example:\n",
        "\n",
        "- User speech transcribed as: `I had otoo accident`\n",
        "- Realtime response interpreted correctly as: `Got it, you had an auto accident`\n",
        "\n",
        "Accurate transcriptions can be very important, particularly when:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Transcripts trigger downstream actions (e.g., tool calls), where errors propagate through the system.\n",
        "- Transcripts are summarized or passed to other components, risking context pollution.\n",
        "- Transcripts are displayed to end users, leading to poor user experiences if errors occur.\n",
        "\n",
        "The potential advantages of using out-of-band transcription include:\n",
        "- **Reduced Mismatch**: The same model is used for both transcription and generation, minimizing inconsistencies between what the user says and how the agent responds.\n",
        "- **Greater Steerability**: The Realtime model is more steerable, can better follow custom instructions for higher transcription quality, and is not limited by a 1024-token input maximum.\n",
        "- **Session Context Awareness**: The model has access to the full session context, so, for example, if you mention your name multiple times, it will transcribe it correctly.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "In terms of **trade-offs**:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Realtime Model (for transcription):\n",
        "    - Audio Input → Text Output: $32.00 per 1M audio tokens + $16.00 per 1M text tokens out.\n",
        "    - Cached Session Context: $0.40 per 1M cached context tokens.\n",
        "\n",
        "    - Total Cost (for 1M audio tokens in + 1M text tokens out): ≈ $48.00\n",

        "\n",
        "    - Using full session context: 16-22x (if transcription cost is 0.001$/session, realtime transcription will be 0.016$/session)\n",
        "       - The cost is higher since you are always passing the growing session context. However, this can potentially help with transcription.\n",
        "    - Using only latest user turn: 3-5x (if transcription cost is 0.001$/session, realtime transcription will be 0.003$/session)\n",
        "       - The cost is lower since you are only transcribing the latest user audio turn. However, you no longer have access to the session context for transcription quality.\n",
        "    - Using 1 < N (turn) < Full Context, the price would be between 3-20x more expensive depending on how many turns you decide to keep in context\n",
        "\n",
        "    - **Note:** These cost estimates are specific to the examples covered in this cookbook. Actual costs may vary depending on factors such as session length, how often context is cached, the ratio of audio to text input, and the details of your particular use case.\n",

        "\n",
        "Your goal is to create a **perfectly faithful** transcript of the latest user turn.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Verbatim fidelity**\n",
        "   - Capture the user’s speech **exactly as spoken**.\n",
        "   - Preserve:\n",
        "     - All words (including incomplete or cut-off words)\n",
        "     - Mispronunciations\n",
        "     - Grammatical mistakes\n",
        "     - Slang and informal language\n",
        "     - Filler words (“um”, “uh”, “like”, “you know”, etc.)\n",
        "     - Self-corrections and restarts\n",
        "     - Repetitions and stutters\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **No rewriting or cleaning**\n",
        "   - Do **not**:\n",
        "     - Fix grammar or spelling\n",
        "     - Replace slang with formal language\n",
        "     - Reorder words\n",
        "     - Simplify or rewrite sentences\n",
        "     - “Smooth out” repetitions or disfluencies\n",
        "   - If the user says something awkward, incorrect, or incomplete, your transcript must **match that awkwardness or incompleteness exactly**.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Spelling and letter sequences**\n",
        "   - If the user spells a word (e.g., “That’s M-A-R-I-A.”), transcribe it exactly as spoken.\n",
        "   - If they spell something unclearly, still reflect what you received, even if it seems wrong.\n",
        "   - Do **not** infer the “intended” spelling; transcribe the letters as they were given.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Numerals and formatting**\n",
        "   - If the user says a number in words (e.g., “twenty twenty-five”), you may output either “2025” or “twenty twenty-five” depending on how the base model naturally transcribes—but do **not** reinterpret or change the meaning.\n",
        "   - Do **not**:\n",
        "     - Convert numbers into different units or formats.\n",
        "     - Expand abbreviations or acronyms beyond what was spoken.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Language and code-switching**\n",
        "   - If the user switches languages mid-sentence, reflect that in the transcript.\n",
        "   - Transcribe non-English content as accurately as possible.\n",
        "   - Do **not** translate; keep everything in the language(s) spoken.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## 3. Disfluencies, Non-Speech Sounds, and Ambiguity\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Disfluencies**\n",
        "   - Always include:\n",
        "     - “Um”, “uh”, “er”\n",
        "     - Repeated words (“I I I think…”)\n",
        "     - False starts (“I went to the— I mean, I stayed home.”)\n",
        "   - Do not remove or compress them.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Non-speech vocalizations**\n",
        "   - If the model’s transcription capabilities represent non-speech sounds (e.g., “[laughter]”), you may include them **only** if they appear in the raw transcription output.\n",
        "   - Do **not** invent labels like “[cough]”, “[sigh]”, or “[laughs]” on your own.\n",
        "   - If the model does not explicitly provide such tokens, **omit them** rather than inventing them.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Unclear or ambiguous audio**\n",
        "   - If parts of the audio are unclear and the base transcription gives partial or uncertain tokens, you must **not** guess or fill in missing material.\n",
        "   - Do **not** replace unclear fragments with what you “think” the user meant.\n",
        "   - Your duty is to preserve exactly what the transcription model produced, even if it looks incomplete or strange.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## 4. Policy Numbers Format\n",
        "\n",
        "The user may sometimes mention **policy numbers**. These must be handled with extra care.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **General rule**\n",
        "   - Always transcribe the policy number exactly as it was spoken.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Expected pattern**\n",
        "   - When the policy number fits the pattern `XXXX-XXXX`:\n",
        "     - `X` can be any letter (A–Z) or digit (0–9).\n",
        "     - Example: `56B5-12C0`\n",
        "   - If the user clearly speaks this pattern, preserve it exactly.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Do not “fix” policy numbers**\n",
        "   - If the spoken policy number does **not** match `XXXX-XXXX` (e.g., different length or missing hyphen), **do not**:\n",
        "     - Invent missing characters\n",
        "     - Add or remove hyphens\n",
        "     - Correct perceived mistakes\n",
        "   - Transcribe **exactly what was said**, even if it seems malformed.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## 5. Punctuation and Casing\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Punctuation**\n",
        "   - Use the punctuation that the underlying transcription model naturally produces.\n",
        "   - Do **not**:\n",
        "     - Add extra punctuation for clarity or style.\n",
        "     - Re-punctuate sentences to “improve” them.\n",
        "   - If the transcription model emits text with **no punctuation**, leave it that way.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Casing**\n",
        "   - Preserve the casing (uppercase/lowercase) as the model output provides.\n",
        "   - Do not change “i” to “I” or adjust capitalization at sentence boundaries unless the model already did so.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## 6. Output Format Requirements\n",
        "Your final output must be a **single, plain-text transcript** of the latest user turn.\n",

        "There are significant price differences between the available methods for transcribing user audio. GPT-4o-Transcribe is by far the most cost-effective approach: it charges only for the raw audio input and a small amount of text output, resulting in transcripts that cost just fractions of a cent per turn. In contrast, using the Realtime model for out-of-band transcription is more expensive. If you transcribe only the latest user turn with Realtime, it typically costs about 3–5× more than GPT-4o-Transcribe. If you include the full session context in each transcription request, the cost can increase to about 16–20× higher. This is because each request to the Realtime model processes the entire session context again at higher pricing, and the cost grows as the conversation gets longer."
