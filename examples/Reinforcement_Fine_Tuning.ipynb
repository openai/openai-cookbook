    "# **Exploring Model Graders for Reinforcement Fine-Tuning**\n",
    "\n",
    "*This guide is for developers and ML practitioners who already know their way around OpenAIʼs APIs, have a basic understanding of reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT), and wish to use their fine-tuned models for research or other appropriate uses. OpenAI’s services are not intended for the personalized treatment or diagnosis of any medical condition and are subject to our [applicable terms](https://openai.com/policies/).*\n",
    "\n",
    "[Reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT)](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/reinforcement-fine-tuning) of reasoning models consists in running reinforcement learning on of top the models to improve their reasoning performance by exploring the solution space and reinforcing strategies that result in a higher reward. RFT helps the model make sharper decisions and interpret context more effectively. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this guide, weʼll walk through how to apply RFT to the OpenAI `o4-mini` reasoning model, using a task from the life sciences research domain: predicting outcomes from doctor-patient transcripts and descriptions, which is a necessary assessment in many health research studies. We'll use a subset of the medical-o1-verifiable-problem [dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/FreedomIntelligence/medical-o1-verifiable-problem/viewer/default/train?row=0). You will learn key steps to take in order to succesfully run RFT jobs for your use-cases.\n",

    "## **1. Setup**\n",
    "\n",
    "Even strong reasoning models can miss the mark when it comes to expert-level behavior-especially in domains like medicine, where nuance and exactness matter. Imagine a model trying to extract [ICD-10](https://www.cms.gov/medicare/coding-billing/icd-10-codes) codes from a transcript: even if it understands the gist, it may not use the precise terminology expected by medical professionals. \n",
    "\n",
    "Other great candidates for RFT include topics like ledger normalization or tiering fraud risk- settings in which you want precise, reliable, and repeatable reasoning. Checkout our [RFT use-cases guide](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/rft-use-cases) for great examples. \n",
    "\n",
    "In our case, weʼll focus on teaching `o4-mini` to become better at predicting the outcomes of clinical conversations and descriptions. Specifically, we want to see if RFT can boost the accuracy of the prediction. \n",
    "\n",
    "Along the way, weʼll talk about how to write effective graders, how they guide the modelʼs learning, and how to watch out for classic reward-hacking pitfalls. "

It provided a starting point, but the signal wasnʼt rich enough for `o4-mini` to truly learn and improve, and a first experiment showed stagnant reward during the RFT run. For the API calls, you should build the python grading function as shown below. "

For any production use-case, domain expert reviewers should verify that model assigned scores reflect preferred answer orderings and align with domain judgment. This typically involves confirming that the model grader correctly ranks predictions according to their validity. In the scope of this cookbook, we approximated this evaluation by using OpenAI `o3` to check whether higher-quality predictions were consistently rewarded relative to their alternatives.\n",

    "While the rubric initially delivered sensible feedback, the model soon uncovered a loophole and began **reward-hacking**. Scores shot up-sometimes by 20-30 percentage points-not because clinical accuracy improved but because the model padded its “one phrase” answers with synonyms, doses, and full management plans. You might see `begin warfarin therapy **and** continue unfractionated heparin for ≥5 days, overlapping until the INR is in the therapeutic range (2–3)` or `chewable aspirin 325 mg stat plus nitroglycerin…` instead of the required `continue unfractionated heparin` or `aspirin` respectively. Although the system prompt is explicit-*“respond with exactly one phrase: the single most likely outcome or phenomenon”*-these verbose outputs inflate *lexical_similarity* scores without precisely adding prediction value. This experience highlights the need to continuously inspect model outputs and remain vigilant for reward-hacking behaviours that can quietly distort evaluation metrics."

    "Looking at the distruibution of scores, we observe that RFT helped shift the model’s predictions out of the mid-to-low score zone (0.2-0.6) and into the high range (0.8-1.0). Since the grader emphasizes clinical similarity over lexical match, this shift reflects stronger medical reasoning-not just better phrasing-according to our *expert* grader. As seen in the (0.0-0.1) range, a handful of already weak predictions fell even further, hinting at a residual knowledge gap.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that, because the earlier `combined_grader` was designed to reward lexical correctness, its accuracy didnʼt improve much-which is expected. That gap reinforces why validating your model grader is critical, and why you should monitor for reward-hacking. In our case, we used `o3` to spot-check grading behavior, but domain expert review is essential. "

Alternatively, an endoscopic ultrasound could be more sensitive, but CT is generally preferred. So, my recommendation is to start with a contrast-enhanced CT scan.\n",

    "Weʼve looked at how to design graders that give `o4-mini` the kind of detailed feedback it needs during RFT. That signal is what helps the model actually learn and improve beyond the baseline. Model graders can be incredibly powerful for this-but only if theyʼre designed carefully. A sloppy grader or sloppy data can send the wrong signals and steer the model in the wrong direction. \n",
