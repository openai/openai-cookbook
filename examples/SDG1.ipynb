    "Synthetic data generation using large language models (LLMs) offers a powerful solution to a commonly faced problem: the availability of high-quality, diverse, and privacy-compliant data. This could be used in a number of scenarios such as training a data science  machine learning model (SVMs, decision trees, KNN's), finetuning a different GPT model on the data, as a solution to the coldstart problem, helping build compelling demos/apps with realistic data, scenario testing etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a number of key drivers which may see you wanting to leverage synthetic data. \n",
    "1. Human data may have privacy restrictions and/or identifiable data within it which we do not want to be used. \n",
    "2. Synthetic data can be much more structured and therefore easier to manipulate than real data. \n",
    "3. In domains where data is sparse or data of certain categories is sparse we may want to augment the data. \n",
    "4. When dealing with imbalanced datasets or datasets which lack diversity, we may want to create data to improve the richness of our datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike traditional data augmentation or manual data creation methods, using LLMs allows for the generation of rich, nuanced, and contextually relevant datasets that can significantly enhance it's usefulness to enterprises and developers.\n",
    "\n",
    "We split this tutorial into 2 parts. In this cookbook, we will have the following agenda:\n",
    "1. CSV with a structured prompt\n",
    "2. CSV with a Python program\n",
    "3. Multitable CSV with a python program\n",
    "4. Simply creating textual data\n",
    "5. Dealing with imbalanced or non-diverse textual data\n",
    "while in part 2, we will look at prompting strategies for getting better textual data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The last two in particular are useful for creating synthetic data to finetune another GPT model. For example using higher quality data produced by `gpt-4o` to finetune the cheaper and quicker `gpt-3.5-turbo` for improved performance while reducing costs.\n"
