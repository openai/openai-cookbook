In this section, we connect OpenAI's Agents SDK to the **dbt Semantic Layer via the MCP server**, so natural-language questions resolve to governed metricsâ€”not ad-hoc SQL. The agent discovers available metrics and dimensions, generates a **Semantic Layer query**, and SL deterministically compiles it to valid warehouse SQL. You get the same answer every time, aligned to your definitions, with the option to inspect the compiled SQL for transparency.\n",

The metrics will include information about joining data across tables and are version controlled in git, like any dbt component.

For examples, you could define a \"number of paid customers\" metric as the count of rows in the table `dim_customers` where the customer didn't cancel during the trial period.\n",
