    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook has demonstrated how OpenAI's fine-tuning framework transforms ChatCompletion format training data into model-ready format for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). Key takeaways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Structured to Sequential**: The conversation structure is converted to a linear sequence with special tokens\n",
    "2. **Selective Loss Computation**: Only assistant responses contribute to the training loss\n",
    "3. **Context-Aware Learning**: The model learns to generate responses based on the full conversation context\n",
    "4. **Efficient Training**: The loss masking ensures the model focuses on learning the desired behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding this process helps you:\n",
    "- Design better training data\n",
    "- Understand why certain formatting matters\n",
    "- Debug fine-tuning issues more effectively\n",
    "- Optimize your training examples for better results\n",
