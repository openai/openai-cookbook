    "# Using logprobs for classification and Q&A evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the use of the `logprobs` parameter in the Chat Completions API. When `logprobs` is enabled, the API returns the log probabilities of each output token, along with a limited number of the most likely tokens at each token position and their log probabilities. The relevant request parameters are:\n",
    "* `logprobs`: Whether to return log probabilities of the output tokens or not. If true, returns the log probabilities of each output token returned in the content of message.\n",
    "* `top_logprobs`: An integer between 0 and 5 specifying the number of most likely tokens to return at each token position, each with an associated log probability. `logprobs` must be set to true if this parameter is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Log probabilities of output tokens indicate the likelihood of each token occurring in the sequence given the context. To simplify, a logprob is `log(p)`, where `p` = probability of a token occurring at a specific position based on the previous tokens in the context. Some key points about `logprobs`:\n",
    "* Higher log probabilities suggest a higher likelihood of the token in that context. This allows users to gauge the model's confidence in its output or explore alternative responses the model considered.\n",
    "* Logprob can be any negative number or `0.0`. `0.0` corresponds to 100% probability.\n",
    "* Logprobs allow us to compute the joint probability of a sequence as the sum of the logprobs of the individual tokens. This is useful for scoring and ranking model outputs. Another common approach is to take the average per-token logprob of a sentence to choose the best generation.\n",
    "* We can examine the `logprobs` assigned to different candidate tokens to understand what options the model considered plausible or implausible.\n",
    "\n",
    "While there are a wide array of use cases for `logprobs`, this notebook will focus on its use for:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Classification tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "* Large Language Models excel at many classification tasks, but accurately measuring the model's confidence in its outputs can be challenging. `logprobs` provide a probability associated with each class prediction, enabling users to set their own classification or confidence thresholds.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Retrieval (Q&A) evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "* `logprobs` can assist with self-evaluation in retrieval applications. In the Q&A example, the model outputs a contrived `has_sufficient_context_for_answer` boolean, which can serve as a confidence score of whether the answer is contained in the retrieved content. Evaluations of this type can reduce retrieval-based hallucinations and enhance accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Autocomplete\n",
    "*  `logprobs` could help us decide how to suggest words as a user is typing.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Token highlighting and outputting bytes\n",
    "*  Users can easily create a token highlighter using the built in tokenization that comes with enabling `logprobs`. Additionally, the bytes parameter includes the ASCII encoding of each output character, which is particularly useful for reproducing emojis and special characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Calculating perplexity\n",
    "* `logprobs` can be used to help us assess the model's overall confidence in a result and help us compare the confidence of results from different prompts."

    "ada_lovelace_article = \"\"\"Augusta Ada King, Countess of Lovelace (née Byron; 10 December 1815 – 27 November 1852) was an English mathematician and writer, chiefly known for her work on Charles Babbage's proposed mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine. She was the first to recognise that the machine had applications beyond pure calculation.\n",
    "Ada Byron was the only legitimate child of poet Lord Byron and reformer Lady Byron. All Lovelace's half-siblings, Lord Byron's other children, were born out of wedlock to other women. Byron separated from his wife a month after Ada was born and left England forever. He died in Greece when Ada was eight. Her mother was anxious about her upbringing and promoted Ada's interest in mathematics and logic in an effort to prevent her from developing her father's perceived insanity. Despite this, Ada remained interested in him, naming her two sons Byron and Gordon. Upon her death, she was buried next to him at her request. Although often ill in her childhood, Ada pursued her studies assiduously. She married William King in 1835. King was made Earl of Lovelace in 1838, Ada thereby becoming Countess of Lovelace.\n",
    "Her educational and social exploits brought her into contact with scientists such as Andrew Crosse, Charles Babbage, Sir David Brewster, Charles Wheatstone, Michael Faraday, and the author Charles Dickens, contacts which she used to further her education. Ada described her approach as \"poetical science\" and herself as an \"Analyst (& Metaphysician)\".\n",
    "When she was eighteen, her mathematical talents led her to a long working relationship and friendship with fellow British mathematician Charles Babbage, who is known as \"the father of computers\". She was in particular interested in Babbage's work on the Analytical Engine. Lovelace first met him in June 1833, through their mutual friend, and her private tutor, Mary Somerville.\n",
    "Between 1842 and 1843, Ada translated an article by the military engineer Luigi Menabrea (later Prime Minister of Italy) about the Analytical Engine, supplementing it with an elaborate set of seven notes, simply called \"Notes\".\n",
    "Lovelace's notes are important in the early history of computers, especially since the seventh one contained what many consider to be the first computer program—that is, an algorithm designed to be carried out by a machine. Other historians reject this perspective and point out that Babbage's personal notes from the years 1836/1837 contain the first programs for the engine. She also developed a vision of the capability of computers to go beyond mere calculating or number-crunching, while many others, including Babbage himself, focused only on those capabilities. Her mindset of \"poetical science\" led her to ask questions about the Analytical Engine (as shown in her notes) examining how individuals and society relate to technology as a collaborative tool.\n",

    "## 5. Calculating perplexity\n",
    "\n",
    "When looking to assess the model's confidence in a result, it can be useful to calculate perplexity, which is a measure of the uncertainty. Perplexity can be calculated by exponentiating the negative of the average of the logprobs. Generally, a higher perplexity indicates a more uncertain result, and a lower perplexity indicates a more confident result. As such, perplexity can be used to both assess the result of an individual model run and also to compare the relative confidence of results between model runs. While a high confidence doesn't guarantee result accuracy, it can be a helpful signal that can be paired with other evaluation metrics to build a better understanding of your prompt's behavior.\n",
