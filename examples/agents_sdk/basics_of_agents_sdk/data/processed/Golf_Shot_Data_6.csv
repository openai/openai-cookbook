To improve, focus on keeping your hands ahead of the ball at impact. This will help lower your attack angle and increase your control. Additionally, the sidespin suggests potential issues with your clubface alignment at impact, so aim to align your body and clubface better to reduce any hooks or slices.",club face alignment drill,1.196976,68.0,101.325,68

Your attack angle is slightly steep at -3.94 degrees, which could lead to more fat or thin shots. Try to lighten your grip pressure and focus on a smoother swing to improve consistency. Additionally, your club path is slightly outside-in, which is causing the ball to curve to the left. Work on your swing path to create a straighter shot.
