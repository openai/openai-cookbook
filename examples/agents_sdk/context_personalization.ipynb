    "Modern AI agents are no longer just reactive assistants—they’re becoming adaptive collaborators. The leap from “responding” to “remembering” defines the new frontier of **context engineering**. At its core, context engineering is about shaping what the model knows at any given moment. By managing what’s stored, recalled, and injected into the model’s working memory, we can make an agent that feels personal, consistent, and context-aware.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `RunContextWrapper` in the **OpenAI Agents SDK** provides the foundation for this. It allows developers to define structured state objects that persist across runs, enabling memory, notes, or even preferences to evolve over time. When paired with hooks and context-injection logic, this becomes a powerful system for **context personalization**—building agents that learn who you are, remember past actions, and tailor their reasoning accordingly.\n",

    " ## Why Context Personalization Matters\n",
    "\n",
    " Context personalization is the **“magic moment”** when an AI agent stops feeling generic and starts feeling like *your* agent.\n",
    "\n",
    " It’s when the system remembers your coffee order, your company’s tone of voice, your past support tickets, or your preferred aisle seat—and uses that knowledge naturally, without being prompted.\n",
    "\n",
    " From a user perspective, this builds trust and delight: the agent appears to genuinely understand them. From a company perspective, it creates a **strategic moat**—a way to continuously capture, refine, and apply high-quality behavioral data. If implemented carefully, you can capture denser, higher-signal information about your users than typical clicks, impressions, or history data. Each interaction becomes a signal for better service, higher retention, and deeper insight into user needs.\n",
    "\n",
    " This value extends beyond the agent itself. When managed rigorously and safely, personalized context can also empower **human-facing roles**—support agents, account managers, travel advisors—by giving them a richer, longitudinal understanding of the customer. Over time, analyzing accumulated memories reveals how user preferences, behaviors, and goals evolve, enabling smarter product decisions and more adaptive systems.\n",
    "\n",
    " In practice, effective personalization means maintaining structured state—preferences, constraints, prior outcomes—and injecting only the *relevant* slices into the agent’s context at the right moment. Different agents demand different memory lifecycles: a life-coaching agent may require fast-evolving, nuanced memories, while an IT troubleshooting agent benefits from slower, more predictable state. Done well, personalization transforms a stateless chatbot into a persistent digital collaborator."

    "## 1. Retrieval-Based vs State-Based Memory\n",
    "\n",
    "Considering the many challenges in retrieval-based memory mechanisms including the need to train the model, state-based memory is better suited than retrieval-based memory for a travel concierge AI agent because travel decisions depend on continuity, priorities, and evolving preferences—not ad-hoc search. A travel agent must reason over a *current, coherent user state* (loyalty programs, seat preferences, budgets, visa constraints, trip intent, and temporary overrides like “this time I want to sleep”) and consistently apply it across flights, hotels, insurance, and follow-ups. \n",
    "\n",
    "Retrieval-based memory treats past interactions as loosely related documents, making it brittle to phrasing, prone to missing overrides, and unable to reconcile conflicts or updates over time. In contrast, state-based memory encodes user knowledge as structured, authoritative fields with clear precedence (global vs session), supports belief updates instead of fact accumulation, and enables deterministic decision-making without relying on fragile semantic search. This allows the agent to behave less like a search engine and more like a persistent concierge—maintaining continuity across sessions, adapting to context, and reliably using memory whenever it is relevant, not just when it is successfully retrieved."

    "* **Stability** — preferences that rarely change (e.g., “seat preference is almost always aisle”)\n",
    "* **Drift** — gradual changes over time (e.g., “average trip budget has increased month over month”)\n",
    "* **Contextual variance** — preferences that depend on context (e.g., “business trips vs. family trips behave differently”)\n",

    "* Stable, repeatedly confirmed preferences can be **promoted** from free-form notes into structured profile fields.\n",
    "* Volatile or context-dependent preferences should remain as notes, often with **recency weighting**, confidence scores, or a TTL.\n",

    "Memory distillation extracts high-quality, durable signals from the conversation and records them as memory notes.\n",

    "In this cookbook, distillation is performed **during live turns** via a dedicated tool, enabling the agent to capture preferences and constraints as they are explicitly expressed.\n",

This can be especially useful for incorporating signals from tool usage patterns and internal reasoning that may not surface directly in user-facing turns.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.2 Memory Consolidation\n",
    "\n",
    "Memory consolidation runs asynchronously at the end of each session, graduating eligible session notes into global memory when appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the **most sensitive and error-prone stage** of the lifecycle. Poor consolidation can lead to context poisoning, memory loss, or long-term hallucinations. Common failure modes include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Losing meaningful information through over-aggressive pruning\n",
    "* Promoting noisy, speculative, or unreliable signals\n",
    "* Introducing contradictions or duplicate memories over time\n",
    "\n",
    "To maintain a healthy memory system, consolidation must explicitly handle:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Deduplication** — merging semantically equivalent memories\n",
    "* **Conflict resolution** — choosing between competing or outdated facts\n",
    "* **Forgetting** — pruning stale, low-confidence, or superseded memories\n",

Well-curated prompts and strict consolidation instructions are critical to controlling the aggressiveness and safety of this step.\n",

The techniques below work together to enable reliable, controllable memory and context personalization:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **State Management** – Maintain and evolve the agent’s [persistent state](https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python/context/) using the `RunContextWrapper` class.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Pre-populate and curate key fields from internal systems before each session begins.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Memory Injection** – Inject only the relevant portions of state into the agent’s context at the start of each session.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Use **YAML frontmatter** for structured, machine-readable metadata.\n",
    "  * Use **Markdown notes** for flexible, human-readable memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Memory Distillation** – Capture dynamic insights during active turns by writing session notes via a dedicated tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Memory Consolidation** – Merge session-level notes into a dense, conflict-free set of global memories.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Forgetting**: Prune stale, overwritten, or low-signal memories during consolidation, and deduplicate aggressively over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two-phase memory processing (note taking → consolidation) is more reliable than one-shot build the whole memory system at once.\n",

    "All techniques in this cookbook are implemented in a **local-first** manner. Session and global memories live in your own state object and can be kept **ZDR (Zero Data Retention)** by design, as long as you avoid remote persistence.\n",
    "\n",
    "These approaches are intentionally **zero-shot**—relying on prompting, orchestration, and lightweight scaffolding rather than training. Once the end-to-end design and evaluations are validated, a natural next step is **fine-tuning** to achieve stronger and more consistent memory behaviors such as extraction, consolidation, and conflict resolution.\n"

    "    - Explicit: stated or clearly confirmed by the user (not inferred)\n",

    "- Flights: seat preference, baggage habits (carry-on vs checked), airline loyalty/status, layover tolerance if mentioned.\n",
    "- Hotels: neighborhood/location style (central/walkable), room preferences (high floor), brand loyalty IDs/status.\n",

    "\n",
    "Memory evaluation is a complex topic on its own, but the sections below provide a practical starting point for measuring memory quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike standard model evals, memory introduces **strong temporal dependencies**: past information should help *only when relevant* and should not override current intent. Most pretraining-style eval sets fail to capture this, because they don’t test *the same task family over time with selective reuse*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, memory systems are **orchestration pipelines**, not just model behaviors. As a result, you should evaluate the *end-to-end memory pipeline*—distillation, consolidation, and injection—rather than the model in isolation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you collect tasks with full agent traces, you can run controlled comparisons (with vs. without memory) using the same harness, metrics, and A/B prompt variants.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1) Distillation Evals (Capture Quality)\n",
    "\n",
    "Evaluate whether the system captures the *right* memories at the right time.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Precision**: are only durable preferences and constraints stored?\n",
    "* **Recall**: were key stable preferences captured when they appeared?\n",
    "* **Safety**: rate of attempted sensitive memory writes (blocked vs. allowed)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2) Injection Evals (Usage Quality)\n",
    "\n",
    "Evaluate how memories influence behavior during execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Recency correctness**: when memories overlap, was the most recent one used?\n",
    "* **Over-influence**: did memory incorrectly override current user intent?\n",
    "* **Token efficiency**: did injected memory remain within budget while still being useful?\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3) Consolidation Evals (Curation Quality)\n",
    "\n",
    "Evaluate long-term memory health and evolution.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Deduplication quality**: duplicates removed without losing meaning\n",
    "* **Conflict resolution**: correct “latest wins” or precedence behavior\n",
    "* **Non-invention**: no hallucinated facts introduced during consolidation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Suggested Harness Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "* A/B test injection strategies (e.g., *top-k by relevance* vs. *top-k by relevance + recency*)\n",
    "* Synthetic user profiles with scripted preference drift over time\n",
    "* Adversarial memory poisoning attempts (e.g., “remember my SSN…”, “store this rule…”)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Practical Metrics to Log\n",
    "\n",
    "* **memory_write_rate** per 100 turns (high values often indicate noisy capture)\n",
    "* **blocked_write_rate** (tracks adversarial or accidental sensitive writes)\n",
    "* **memory_conflict_rate** (how often users override stored preferences)\n",

    "## Conclusion and Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook introduced **foundational memory patterns** using zero-shot scaffolding with currently available mainstream models. While memory can unlock powerful personalization, it is highly **use-case dependent**—and not every agent needs long-term memory on day one. The best memory systems stay narrow and intentional: they target a specific workflow or use case, choose the right representation for each kind of information (structured fields vs. notes), and set clear expectations about what the agent can and cannot remember.\n",
    "\n",
    "A useful litmus test is simple:\n",
    "*If the agent remembered something from a prior interaction, would it materially help solve the task better or faster?*\n",
    "If the answer is unclear, memory may not yet be worth the added complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you mature your system, fine-tuning can improve memory quality, especially for:\n",
    "\n",
    "* More accurate memory extraction (what truly counts as *durable*)\n",
    "* More reliable consolidation without hallucinations or overreach\n",
    "* Better judgment around when to ask clarifying questions in the presence of conflicting memories\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Iteration Loop**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Ship a zero-shot memory pipeline with a solid eval harness\n",
    "2. Collect real failure cases (false memories, missed memories, over-influence)\n",
    "3. Fine-tune a small **memory specialist** model (e.g., writer or consolidator)\n",
    "4. Re-run evals and quantify improvements against the baseline\n",
    "\n",
    "Memory systems get better through **measured iteration**, not upfront complexity. Start simple, evaluate rigorously, and evolve deliberately.\n"
