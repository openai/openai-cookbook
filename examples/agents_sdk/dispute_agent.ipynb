    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "We recently announced our new open-source **Agents SDK**, designed to help you build agentic AI applications using a lightweight, easy-to-use package with minimal abstractions.\n",
    "\n",
    "This cookbook demonstrates how you can leverage the Agents SDK in combination with Stripe's API to handle dispute management, a common operational challenge many businesses face. Specifically, we focus on two real-world scenarios:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Company Mistake:**  \n",
    "   A scenario where the company clearly made an error, such as failing to fulfill an order, where accepting the dispute the appropriate action.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Customer Dispute (Final Sale):**  \n",
    "   A scenario where a customer knowingly disputes a transaction despite receiving the correct item and understanding that the purchase was final sale, requiring further investigation to gather supporting evidence.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address these scenarios, we'll introduce three distinct agents:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Triage Agent:**  \n",
    "  Determines whether to accept or escalate a dispute based on the fulfillment status of the order.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Acceptance Agent:**  \n",
    "  Handles clear-cut cases by automatically accepting disputes, providing concise reasoning.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Investigator Agent:**  \n",
    "  Conducts deeper investigations into disputes by examining customer emails, verifying IP addresses, shipping addresses, and other granular details to gather the necessary evidence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this cookbook, we’ll guide you step-by-step, illustrating how custom agentic workflows can automate dispute management and support your business operations.\n"

    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "Before running this cookbook, you must set up the following accounts and complete a few setup actions. These prerequisites are essential to interact with the APIs used in this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. OpenAI Account\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Purpose:**  \n",
    "  You need an OpenAI account to access language models and use the Agents SDK featured in this cookbook.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Action:**  \n",
    "  [Sign up for an OpenAI account](https://openai.com) if you don’t already have one. Once you have an account, create an API key by visiting the [OpenAI API Keys page](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Stripe Account\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Purpose:**  \n",
    "  A Stripe account is required to simulate payment processing, manage disputes, and interact with the Stripe API as part of our demo workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Action:**  \n",
    "  Create a free Stripe account by visiting the [Stripe Signup Page](https://dashboard.stripe.com/register).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Locate Your API Keys:**  \n",
    "  Log in to your Stripe dashboard and navigate to **Developers > API keys**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Use Test Mode:**  \n",
    "  Use your **Test Secret Key** for all development and testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Create a .env file with your OpenAI API and Stripe API Keys\n",
