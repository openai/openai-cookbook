    "*This guide is intended for readers already familiar with OpenAI models and building LLM agents.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Building a complex, multistep AI system often benefits from **multiple agents working in tandem**. This guide demonstrates how to orchestrate a team of agents using the OpenAI Agents SDK, through the example of a **portfolio research workflow**. Here, specialized agents (Macro, Fundamental, Quantitative) collaborate under a Portfolio Manager agent to solve a challenging investment analysis problem. We focus on high-level architecture, tool usage, and best practices for multi-agent collaboration, with all code and assets drawn from this repo.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this guide, you'll understand how to design a multi-agent system, choose collaboration patterns, configure various tool types for each agent, and run the system with tracing for observability.\n",

    "## What is Multi-Agent Collaboration?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Multi-agent collaboration** means multiple autonomous agents (LLM \"nodes\") coordinate to achieve an overarching goal that would be difficult for a single agent to handle. Instead of one monolithic prompt, each agent handles a specific subtask or expertise area, and an orchestration layer connects these agent \"nodes\" into a coherent workflow. This approach is useful for complex systems – for example, a financial analysis might be broken into macro-economic analysis, fundamental company analysis, and quantitative signal analysis, each handled by a different agent specialist. The agents share information and their results are combined to produce a final outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Collaboration Patterns: Handoff vs. Agent-as-Tool\n",
    "\n",
    "The OpenAI Agents SDK supports multiple patterns for agents to work together:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Handoff Collaboration:** One agent can _handoff_ control to another agent mid-problem. In a handoff architecture, each agent knows about the others and can decide when to defer to a more appropriate agent. This is flexible for open-ended or conversational workflows, but can make it harder to maintain a global view of the task. [Read more in the SDK docs.](https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python/handoffs/)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Agent as a Tool:** In this approach, one agent (often a central planner or manager) **calls other agents as if they were tools**. Sub-agents don't take over the conversation; instead, the main agent invokes them for specific subtasks and incorporates their results. This model keeps a single thread of control (the main agent orchestrates everything) and tends to simplify coordination. **This repo uses the agent-as-tool model:** the Portfolio Manager agent remains in charge, using the other specialist agents as tools when it needs their expertise. This choice keeps the overall reasoning transparent and allows parallel execution of sub-tasks, which is ideal for complex analyses.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more on these collaboration patterns, see the [OpenAI Agents SDK documentation](https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python/multi_agent/).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Architecture Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Our system follows a **hub-and-spoke design**. The **Portfolio Manager agent** is the hub (central coordinator), and the **specialist agents** are the spokes. The user's query (e.g. \"How would a planned interest rate reduction affect my GOOGL holdings?\") goes first to the Portfolio Manager. The Portfolio Manager agent is prompted to break down the problem and delegate to the appropriate specialist agents. It treats each specialist as a callable tool, invoking them for their portion of the analysis. All three report back to the Portfolio Manager, which then synthesizes a final answer for the user.\n",

    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Supported Tool Types\n",
    "\n",
    "A key advantage of the Agents SDK is the flexibility in defining **tools** that agents can use. Tools can range from simple Python functions to external services. In this project, we use:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **MCP (Model Context Protocol) Server:** Used to connect agents to external tools and data sources in a standardized way. This project uses a local MCP server for Yahoo Finance data (see `mcp/yahoo_finance_server.py`). [Learn more: OpenAI MCP docs](https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python/mcp/) | [MCP Spec](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **OpenAI Managed Tools:** Managed tools are built-in, hosted tools provided by OpenAI that require no custom implementation. They offer powerful capabilities out of the box, such as **Code Interpreter** (for quantitative/statistical analysis) and **WebSearch** (for up-to-date news and data). These tools are easy to integrate, maintained by OpenAI, and allow agents to perform advanced actions like code execution and real-time information retrieval without additional setup.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Custom Tools:** Custom tools are any Python functions you define and register as tools for your agent. The Agents SDK makes this easy: just decorate your function, and the SDK will automatically extract its name, docstring, and input schema. This is ideal for domain-specific logic, data access, or workflow extensions. \n",
    "  In our project, we use custom tools to access FRED economic data ([see FRED API](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/docs/api/api_key.html)) and perform file system operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Custom tools give you full flexibility to extend your agent's capabilities beyond built-in or managed tools. [See the SDK docs on function tools.](https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python/tools/#function-tools)\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Want to add more tools?** The SDK supports a wide range of tool types, including web search, file search, code execution, and more. [See the full list of supported tools in the SDK documentation.](https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python/tools/)\n",

    "## Breaking Down the Head Portfolio Manager Agent\n",
    "\n",
    "The Head Portfolio Manager (PM) agent is the orchestrator of the entire workflow. It coordinates a set of four specialist agents, each focused on a different area of expertise. This design is intentional: overloading a single agent with every possible responsibility leads to shallow, generic outputs and makes it hard to maintain or improve your system over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This Design?\n",
    "By breaking the problem into specialized agents—each with a clear role—you get:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Deeper, higher-quality research:** Each agent can focus on its domain, using the right tools and prompts for the job. The PM agent brings these perspectives together for a more nuanced, robust answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Modularity and clarity:** You can update, test, or improve one agent without affecting the others. This makes your system easier to maintain and extend as your needs evolve.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Faster results through parallelism:** Independent agents can work at the same time, dramatically reducing the time to complete complex, multi-part analyses.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Consistency and auditability:** A structured, prompt-driven workflow ensures every run follows best practices, is easy to debug, and produces outputs you can trust and review.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach is ideal for any application where you want depth, specialization, and reliability—whether you're building a research assistant, a decision support tool, or any system that benefits from expert collaboration and orchestration.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How We Implement This in Practice:**\n",
    "- Each specialist agent (Fundamental, Macro, Quantitative) is wrapped as a callable tool using the SDK's `function_tool` decorator, with custom names and descriptions. This makes the PM agent's toolset explicit and LLM-friendly.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The Head PM agent uses the `run_all_specialists_parallel` tool to invoke all three specialists concurrently, leveraging `parallel_tool_calls=True` for maximum speed and efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The agent's prompt is loaded from a markdown file (`pm_base.md`), encoding not just the firm's philosophy but also detailed tool usage rules and a step-by-step workflow. This ensures every run is consistent, auditable, and aligned with best practices.\n",
    "\n",
    "- After gathering and reviewing the specialist outputs, the PM agent uses a dedicated memo editor tool to assemble, format, and finalize the investment report. This separation of concerns keeps the workflow modular and easy to extend.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The system is designed for extensibility: you can add new specialist agents, swap out tools, or update prompts without breaking the overall orchestration logic. All tool calls, agent decisions, and outputs are captured in OpenAI Traces for full transparency and debugging.\n",
    "\n",
    "These implementation choices directly support the benefits above—enabling deep, modular, and reliable multi-agent research workflows that are easy to maintain, audit, and improve.\n",

       "\n",
       "Alphabet (GOOGL) presents a compelling, yet nuanced, investment case as of May 2025. The stock trades at $168.47/share, with robust fundamentals, a fortress balance sheet, and strong analyst consensus. However, the probability of achieving a 7% return by year-end is less than 50% in most modeled scenarios, even with a planned interest rate reduction. This thesis is deeply aligned with the firm's vision: it is differentiated, scenario-driven, and risk-aware, challenging the prevailing market optimism by quantifying the material risks from tariffs, regulatory action, and AI competition. While consensus expects a rebound on rate cuts and digital tailwinds, our integrated analysis highlights that macro and idiosyncratic risks could easily derail the bull case. The original insight here is that a rate cut, while directionally positive, is not a panacea for GOOGL, and tail risks remain underappreciated by the market. Both best- and worst-case scenarios are explicitly considered, with scenario probabilities and risk factors supported by historical event studies and current data. This approach embodies the firm's edge: we do not simply follow consensus, but rigorously test it and plan for both upside and downside.\n",

Search and YouTube continue to benefit from digital ad demand, while Cloud is growing at 30% YoY, albeit with some margin pressure. The company's moat is underpinned by dominant platforms, proprietary AI, and massive data scale. However, 2025 tariffs threaten ~7% of search revenue, and regulatory scrutiny is a persistent overhang.

The original, evidence-based insight here is that while fundamentals are strong and consensus is bullish, the risks from tariffs, regulation, and AI competition are not fully priced in. The scenario analysis below (see Quant section) quantifies these risks. This view is differentiated from consensus by explicitly modeling downside scenarios and not assuming a rate cut alone will deliver the desired return. All data is current as of Q1 2025, with robust coverage of financials, news, and analyst sentiment. The main data gap is the uncertainty around the timing/magnitude of rate cuts and the final form of 2025 tariffs.\n",

       "## Macro Perspective\n",
       "\n",
       "The macro environment is characterized by a Federal Funds Rate of 4.33% (April 2025), CPI at 320.3, GDP at $29.98T, and unemployment at 4.2%. The FOMC projects two rate cuts in 2025, totaling 50bps, but the timing is uncertain due to economic and policy risks, especially tariffs. The Trump administration's tariff policies have introduced significant uncertainty, and the Fed has signaled that substantial tariffs could require further rate cuts to counteract economic stagnation. The technology sector, including GOOGL, is sensitive to these macro and policy shifts. \n",
       "\n",
       "Tail-risk scenarios are explicitly considered:\n",
       "- If rate cuts are successful, GOOGL could benefit from a lower cost of capital and sector rotation into tech, supporting the bull case.\n",
       "- If rate cuts fail to stimulate growth, or if tariffs escalate, GOOGL's ad revenues and international business could be hit, supporting the bear or tail case.\n",
       "- An unexpected inflation surge could force higher rates, depressing GOOGL's valuation.\n",
       "\n",
       "The consensus macro view is that rate cuts will support equities, but our variant view is that this is not guaranteed—rate cuts may not be effective if trade tensions and inflation persist. The effectiveness of rate cuts is contingent on broader economic conditions, and the technology sector's sensitivity to global trade dynamics means that tariff escalations could offset the benefits of lower rates. This scenario-driven, risk-aware approach is directly aligned with the firm's vision.\n",

       "The scenario simulation and event study highlight that even with a rate cut and strong fundamentals, there is a substantial probability (~60%) that GOOGL does **not** achieve a 7% return by year-end, especially if macro or sector-specific risks materialize. This is a more nuanced view than the analyst consensus, and is directly aligned with the firm's vision of differentiated, evidence-based scenario planning.

       "\n",
       "The PM synthesis is that while a planned interest rate reduction is directionally positive for GOOGL, it is not a panacea. The probability of achieving a 7% return by year-end is less than 50% in most modeled scenarios, with tail risks (tariffs, regulatory shocks, macro surprises) remaining material. The consensus is bullish, but both quant and fundamental analyses highlight that even with strong fundamentals and positive analyst sentiment, macro and idiosyncratic risks could easily derail the bull case. The differentiated, risk-aware thesis here is that GOOGL's exposure to tariffs, regulatory action, and AI competition could cap upside or even lead to underperformance despite rate cuts. Investors should not assume a rate cut alone will deliver the desired return, and should remain vigilant for new macro or sector-specific shocks. The scenario probabilities and risk factors are well-supported by both historical event studies and current data. This is a differentiated, risk-aware thesis that challenges the consensus optimism and is fully aligned with the firm's vision.\n",
       "\n",
       "## Recommendation & Answer to the Question\n",
       "\n",
       "The actionable recommendation is to maintain a constructive, but risk-aware, position in GOOGL. While the stock is fundamentally strong and a rate cut is directionally positive, the probability of achieving a 7% return by year-end is less than 50% in most scenarios. This recommendation embodies the firm's vision by being original, evidence-based, and scenario-driven, explicitly planning for both best- and worst-case outcomes. If the recommendation aligns with consensus, it is only because the evidence justifies it; where it diverges, it is because the risks are not fully priced in. The trade-off is between participating in potential upside from rate cuts and digital tailwinds, versus the material risk of underperformance from tariffs, regulation, or macro shocks. Investors should size positions accordingly, monitor macro and policy developments closely, and be prepared to adjust exposure if downside risks materialize.\n",

    "## Best Practices When Building Agents\n",
    "\n",
    "The most effective agentic systems combine modular agent design, clear tool definitions, parallel execution, and structured prompts. This approach—central to the OpenAI Agents SDK—makes your workflows robust, scalable, and easy to debug or extend.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key features of the OpenAI Agents SDK that enable these best practices:**\n",
    "- **Agent loop:** Handles tool calls, LLM reasoning, and workflow control automatically.\n",
    "- **Python-first orchestration:** Use familiar Python patterns to chain, compose, and orchestrate agents.\n",
    "- **Handoffs:** Delegate tasks between agents for specialization and modularity.\n",
    "- **Guardrails:** Validate inputs/outputs and break early on errors for reliability.\n",
    "- **Function tools:** Register any Python function as a tool, with automatic schema and validation.\n",
    "- **Tracing:** Visualize, debug, and monitor every step of your workflow for full transparency.\n",
    "\n",
    "A combination of well-designed tools, thoughtful orchestration, and careful model selection is crucial for building effective agent systems. In this example, we use the GPT-4.1 family of models for their strong analytical and tool-use capabilities ([see the GPT-4.1 Prompting Guide](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/gpt4-1_prompting_guide)). For deeper architectural best practices, see the included [A Practical Guide to Building Agents (PDF)](https://cdn.openai.com/business-guides-and-resources/a-practical-guide-to-building-agents.pdf). By bringing these elements together, you get a system that is robust, scalable, and easy to debug or extend.\n",
