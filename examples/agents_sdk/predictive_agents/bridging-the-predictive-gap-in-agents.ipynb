    "# Bridging the predictive gap in agents with the KumoRFM MCP\n",
    "Agents today are fundamentally reactive, they excel at responding to what's happening right now. Commonplace agentic tools like RAG and (web)search allow agents to retrieve information from databases, process documents, and otherwise compile available information in order to facilitate the agents' actions, be it responding to a customer inqury or performing a sequence of actions with available tools. But the most valuable business decisions require anticipating what will happen next.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a customer service agent that can instantly lookup a customer's policy details and transaction history. It's incredibly helpful for handling current inquiries, but what if that same agent could predict which customers are about to churn and proactively suggest retention strategies? Or an underwriting agent that doesn't just process applications, but predicts which applicants represent the best long-term value? The difference between reactive and predictive agents is the difference between managing problems and preventing them."

    "## Why Agents Need Predictive Capabilities\n",
    "For agents to make truly informed decisions about what actions to take, they must go beyond simple data retrieval and synthesis. Agents need to be able to take the available enterprise data and produce quantitative predictions in which they will ground their future actions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Just like executives in large organizations rely on human analysts to guide their strategic decisions and enterprises rely on **predictive machine learning models** to optimize customer experience (recommender systems, personalization, etc.) and improve their operations (fraud detection, demand forecasting, etc.), agents too will need to rely on predictive tools to operate optimally.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How agents predict today\n",
    "When organizations attempt to add predictive capabilities to their agents, they typically pursue one of two approaches, each with significant limitations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Approach 1: Pre-Built Predictive Services\n",
    "The most common approach involves implementing dedicated predictive services or integrating with existing ML platforms, then connecting agents to these rigid prediction endpoints.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{python}\n",
    "@tool\n",
    "def churn_risk(customer_id):\n",
    "    # call to service\n",
    "    return churn_probability\n",
    "\n",
    "@ tool \n",
    "def recommendation(customer_id):\n",
    "    # call to service\n",
    "    return recommendations\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Core Issues with Pre-Built Services\n",
    "* **Development Time and Expertise Requirements:** Each prediction service requires months of specialized development with data scientists, ML engineers, and infrastructure teams. A simple churn prediction service may take many months from conception to production.\n",
    "* **Rigid Agentic Flows:** Agents become constrained to pre-determined prediction types. If a customer interaction reveals an unexpected need like predicting optimal policy renewal timing, the agent cannot adapt.\n",
    "* **Inflexibility/Maintenance cost**: Any change to business requirements or data schemas requires rebuilding the entire ML pipeline from feature engineering to model retraining. Traditional model services are also expensive and difficult to maintain, requiring subsantial knowledge to keep running.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Approach 2: MLE-Agent (or Agent-as-a-Data-Scientist)\n",
    "The second approach attempts to make agents themselves responsible for building and maintaining predictive models using SQL, Python, and other ML tools. While it is amazing to see the latest LLMs perform well on the core task of training ML models from scratch, deploying ML models goes far beyond training - reliability of the tool across diverse tasks, and deployment scenarios becomes the core issue [1] for agent builders to overcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Core Issues with MLE-Agents\n",
    "* **Extremely Difficult Tool Development**: Machine Learning Engineering requires deep knowledge, building an agent or sub-agent/tool which reliably performs well on MLE tasks is difficult and adds much complexity to the already difficult task of developing useful agents.\n",
    "* **Reliability Issues** : Agents can make critical errors in data preprocessing, feature selection, or model validation that lead to poor prediction performance. ML pipelines have many decision points where agent judgment can go wrong.\n",
    "* **Doesn't Solve Fundamental Problems**: MLE-Agents still need to train individual models for each prediction task they want to solve, this nullifies the promised advantage of grounding agentic actions in many diverse predictions in a single sequence."

    "## Agentic predictions of the future\n",
    "Both traditional approaches treat prediction as a separate, specialized capability that must be explicitly built for each use case. This paradigm fundamentally misaligns with how agents work best: through flexible, conversational reasoning that adapts to context.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The In-Context Prediction Paradigm\n",
    "What if predictive capabilities worked more like large language models? LLMs don't require task-specific training to understand new domains or generate relevant text. They adapt through in-context learning, using examples and context to understand what's needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider how an LLM handles a new task:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Human: \"Write a product launch email for insurance\"\n",
    "LLM: [Adapts to context, generates relevant content without specific training]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now imagine prediction working the same way:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Human: \"Predict if customer XYZ will cancel their auto insurance in 30 days?\"  \n",
    "Model: [Adapts to prediction context, generates forecasts without task-specific training]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Relational In-Context Learning: The Missing Piece\n",
    "A new paradigm is emerging in machine learning: in-context learning for predictive tasks. Relational (or multi-table) in-context learning solves many fundamental problems we discussed in previous sections. Relational Foundation Models (RFMs) work with relational data (databases) directly and can make predictions without task-specific training, learning patterns from contextual examples similar to how LLMs handle new text generation tasks. These approaches enable:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Zero feature engineering:** The model learns predictive patterns from raw relational data\n",
    "* **Multi-table reasoning:** Reason across various entities (e.g. Customers, Policies) and their interactions (Claims, Cancellations) natively\n",
    "* **Schema adaptation:** Instantly working with new data structures without preprocessing pipelines\n",
    "* **Rich business context:** Leveraging the full complexity of enterprise data relationships\n",
    "\n",
    "### KumoRFM: Foundation Model Intelligence for Relational Data\n",
    "**Kumo Relational Foundation Model (KumoRFM)** [2] brings this vision to reality as the world's first Relational Foundation Model, extending in-context learning principles to multi-table enterprise data. By representing databases as temporal heterogeneous graphs, KumoRFM can generate predictions directly from existing database schemas without feature engineering or model training.\n",
    "\n",
    "For agents, this means predictions become as natural as text generation: conversational, adaptive, and instantly available across any prediction task your business data can support."

    "## Solution Overview: Building Predictive Agents with KumoRFM MCP\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Predictive Agent Architecture Pattern\n",
    "**KumoRFM MCP** [3, 4] enables a new architectural pattern for building intelligent agents that seamlessly integrate predictions into business workflows. Instead of treating prediction as a separate service or complex ML pipeline, predictions become natural agent capabilities accessible through conversational interfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "This pattern consists of three specialized agents working together:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Assessment Agent:** Analyzes available data and determines prediction feasibility given KumoRFM capabilities\n",
    "* **Prediction Agent:** Executes the desired predictions with available data\n",
    "* **Action Agent:** Processes prediction results into business actions\n",
    "\n",
    "The key insight is that KumoRFM's in-context learning capabilities enable agents to make sophisticated predictions using only natural language and PQL (predictive query language) understanding, eliminating the need for ML expertise, feature engineering, or model training. Just as LLMs democratized text generation through simple prompting, KumoRFM democratizes prediction through **predictive-prompting** in combination with a relational foundation model interface that any agent can master."
