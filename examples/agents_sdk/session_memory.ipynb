    "AI agents often operate in **long-running, multi-turn interactions**, where keeping the right balance of **context** is critical. If too much is carried forward, the model risks distraction, inefficiency, or outright failure. If too little is preserved, the agent loses coherence. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here, context refers to the total window of tokens (input + output) that the model can attend to at once. For [GPT-5](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-5), this capacity is up to 272k input tokens and 128k output tokens but even such a large window can be overwhelmed by uncurated histories, redundant tool results, or noisy retrievals. This makes context management not just an optimization, but a necessity.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this cookbook, we’ll explore how to **manage context effectively using the `Session` object from the [OpenAI Agents SDK](https://github.com/openai/openai-agents-python)**, focusing on two proven context management techniques—**trimming** and **compression**—to keep agents fast, reliable, and cost-efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why Context Management Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Sustained coherence across long threads** – Keep the agent anchored to the latest user goal without dragging along stale details. Session-level trimming and summaries prevent “yesterday’s plan” from overriding today’s ask.\n",
    "* **Higher tool-call accuracy** – Focused context improves function selection and argument filling, reducing retries, timeouts, and cascading failures during multi-tool runs.\n",
    "* **Lower latency & cost** – Smaller, sharper prompts cut tokens per turn and attention load.\n",
    "* **Error & hallucination containment** – Summaries act as “clean rooms” that correct or omit prior mistakes; trimming avoids amplifying bad facts (“context poisoning”) turn after turn.\n",
    "* **Easier debugging & observability** – Stable summaries and bounded histories make logs comparable: you can diff summaries, attribute regressions, and reproduce failures reliably.\n",
    "* **Multi-issue and handoff resilience** – In multi-problem chats, per-issue mini-summaries let the agent pause/resume, escalate to humans, or hand off to another agent while staying consistent.\n"

    "\n",
    "You can continue a conversation by passing the prior response’s `id` as `previous_response_id`, or you can manage context manually by collecting outputs into a list and resubmitting them as the `input` for the next response.\n",
    "\n",
    "What you don’t get is **automatic memory management**. That’s where the **Agents SDK** comes in. It provides [session memory](https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python/sessions/) on top of Responses, so you no longer need to manually append `response.output` or track IDs yourself. The session becomes the **memory object**: you simply call `session.run(\"...\")` repeatedly, and the SDK handles context length, history, and continuity—making it far easier to build coherent, multi-turn agents."

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "* **Multi-turn Customer Service Conversations**\n",
    "In extended conversations about tech products—spanning both hardware and software—customers often surface multiple issues over time. The agent must stay consistent and goal-focused while retaining only the essentials rather than hauling along every past detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Techniques Covered\n",
    "\n",
    "To address these challenges, we introduce two separate concrete approaches using OpenAI Agents SDK:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Context Trimming** – dropping older turns while keeping the last N turns.\n",
    "  - **Pros**\n",
    "\n",
    "    * **Deterministic & simple:** No summarizer variability; easy to reason about state and to reproduce runs.\n",
    "    * **Zero added latency:** No extra model calls to compress history.\n",
    "    * **Fidelity for recent work:** Latest tool results, parameters, and edge cases stay verbatim—great for debugging.\n",
    "    * **Lower risk of “summary drift”:** You never reinterpret or compress facts.\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Cons**\n",
    "\n",
    "    * **Forgets long-range context abruptly:** Important earlier constraints, IDs, or decisions can vanish once they scroll past N.\n",
    "    * **User experience “amnesia”:** Agent can appear to “forget” promises or prior preferences midway through long sessions.\n",
    "    * **Wasted signal:** Older turns may contain reusable knowledge (requirements, constraints) that gets dropped.\n",
    "    * **Token spikes still possible:** If a recent turn includes huge tool payloads, your last-N can still blow up the context.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **Best when**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Your tasks in the conversation is indepentent from each other with non-overlapping context that does not reuqire carrying previous details further.\n",
    "    - You need predictability, easy evals, and low latency (ops automations, CRM/API actions).\n",
    "    - The conversation’s useful context is local (recent steps matter far more than distant history).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Context Summarization** – compressing prior messages(assistant, user, tools, etc.) into structured, shorter summaries injected into the conversation history.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **Pros**\n",
    "\n",
    "    * **Retains long-range memory compactly:** Past requirements, decisions, and rationales persist beyond N.\n",
    "    * **Smoother UX:** Agent “remembers” commitments and constraints across long sessions.\n",
    "    * **Cost-controlled scale:** One concise summary can replace hundreds of turns.\n",
    "    * **Searchable anchor:** A single synthetic assistant message becomes a stable “state of the world so far.”\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Cons**\n",
    "\n",
    "    * **Summarization loss & bias:** Details can be dropped or misweighted; subtle constraints may vanish.\n",
    "    * **Latency & cost spikes:** Each refresh adds model work (and potentially tool-trim logic).\n",
    "    * **Compounding errors:** If a bad fact enters the summary, it can **poison** future behavior (“context poisoning”).\n",
    "    * **Observability complexity:** You must log summary prompts/outputs for auditability and evals.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **Best when**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - You have use cases where your tasks needs context collected accross the flow such as  planning/coaching, RAG-heavy analysis, policy Q&A.\n",
    "    - You need continuity over long horizons and carry the important details further to solve related tasks.\n",
    "    - Sessions exceed N turns but must preserve decisions, IDs, and constraints reliably.\n",

    "\n",
    "* On **write**: `add_items(...)` appends the new items, then immediately trims the stored history.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Treat any item with `role == \"user\"` as a **user message** (via `_is_user_msg`).\n",
    "2. Scan the history **backwards** and collect the indices of the last **N** user messages (`max_turns`).\n",
    "3. Find the **earliest** index among those N user messages.\n",
    "4. **Keep everything from that index to the end**; drop everything before it.\n",

    "* **Guidance & Examples:** Steer the summary with clear guidance. Where possible, extract concrete examples from the conversation history to make future turns more grounded and context-rich.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Hallucination Control:** Be precise in what you include. Even minor hallucinations in a summary can propagate forward, contaminating future context with inaccuracies.\n",

    "* **Turn boundary preserved at the “fresh” side**: the **`keep_last_n_turns` user turns** remain verbatim; everything older is compressed.\n",

    "* **Async + lock discipline**: we **release the lock** while the (potentially slow) summarization runs; then re-check the condition before applying the summary to avoid racey merges.\n",

    "* **Transcript Replay:** Re-run long conversations and measure next-turn accuracy with and without context trimming. Metrics could include exact match on entities/IDs and rubric-based scoring on reasoning quality.\n",
    "* **Error Regression Tracking:** Watch for common failure modes—unanswered questions, dropped constraints, or unnecessary/repeated tool calls.\n",
