    "# Build with Realtime Mini\n",
    "\n",
    "Growing up, I was fascinated by the idea of Jarvis—an intelligent assistant that could autonomously handle complex workflows. What I didn’t realize back then was that I was imagining the future of voice agents. OpenAI was the first to make this vision real with the launch of `4o-audio`, and more recently made it even more accessible—cutting costs by 70%—with the release of [GPT Realtime Mini](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-realtime-mini), which offers lower latency and major improvements in tool calling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Building with speech models, however, is fundamentally different from working with text-only interfaces. In addition to prompt engineering, audio models bring new challenges: they’re more latency-sensitive, require managing a WebRTC session, and introduce additional variability through voice activity detection (VAD).\n",
    "\n",
    "To make this process easier, OpenAI has released the Agents SDK in both Python and TypeScript, along with detailed examples that showcase our recommended design patterns for building reliable voice agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before diving into code, let’s map out exactly what we’ll be building—and how it fits into the broader agent handoff architecture."

    "## System Architecture\n",
    "For our application today we are going to be building an extremely simple customer support app using the **“handoff architecture”**. **“Handoff Architecture”** means a **primary agent** acts as the orchestrator for all incoming customer queries. Rather than handling every request directly, the primary agent analyzes the intent behind the user’s message and **categorizes it into one of 2 core pathways**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. General questions and basic support (no authenticator required).\n",
    "2. Specific questions (user authentication required before lookup is performed).\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on this categorization, the primary agent **hands off the conversation** to the appropriate specialist agent designed for that specific task.\n",
