    "This page provides an instruction & guide for developers building a GPT Action for a specific application. Before you proceed, make sure to first familiarize yourself with the following information:\n",

    "\n",
    "* [Introduction to GPT Actions](https://platform.openai.com/docs/actions/introduction)\n",

    "* [Example of Building a GPT Action from Scratch](https://platform.openai.com/docs/actions/getting-started)\n",
    "\n",
    "This particular GPT Action provides an overview of how to connect to **Google Drive**, Google’s File storage system. This action will allow you to list and query against file names, load the file content into your GPT, and ultimately use that data as context in ChatGPT.  This set of actions is extensible by additional methods found via the [Google Drive API](https://developers.google.com/drive/api/guides/about-sdk).  This is great if you want a generalist GPT that can read smaller files, such as: \n",

    "* Meetings minutes\n",
    "* Product design documents\n",
    "* Short memos\n",
    "* Frequently-asked questions\n",
    "\n",
    "For something that wants to read longer memos such as entire books, complex CSVs with many rows, we suggest building a Google Docs or Google Sheets-specific GPT.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Value + Example business case\n",
    "\n",
    "Users can now leverage ChatGPT's natural language capability to connect directly to files in Google Drive\n",
    "\n",
    "Example Use Cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A user needs to look up which files relate to a certain topic\n",
    "- A user needs an answer to a critical question, buried deep in documents\n",
