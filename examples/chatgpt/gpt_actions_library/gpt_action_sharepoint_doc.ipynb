    "- Why are you using the Microsoft Graph API in your code instead of the [SharePoint API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/sp-add-ins/get-to-know-the-sharepoint-rest-service?tabs=csom)?\n",
    "\n",
    "  - The SharePoint API is legacy - per the Microsoft documentation [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/apis/sharepoint-rest-graph), “For SharePoint Online, innovation using a REST API against SharePoint is driven via the Microsoft Graph REST API's.” The Graph API gives us more flexibility, and the SharePoint API still runs into the same file issues listed in the [Why is this necessary instead of interacting with the Microsoft Graph API directly?](#why-is-this-necessary-instead-of-interacting-with-the-microsoft-api-directly) section.\n",

    "- Why do I need to request an OBO token?\n",
    "\n",
    "  - When you try to use the same token to authenticate to the Graph API as the one you use to authenticate into the Azure Function, you get an “invalid audience” token. This is because the audience for the token can only be user\\_impersonation.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - To address this, the function requests a new token scoped to Files.Read.All within the app using the [On Behalf Of flow](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/v2-oauth2-on-behalf-of-flow). This will inherit the permissions of the logged in user, meaning this function will only search through files the logged-in user has access to. \n",
    "\n",
    "  - We are purposefully requesting a new On Behalf Of token with each request, because Azure Function Apps are meant to be stateless. You could potentially integrate this with Azure Key Vault to store the secret and retrieve programmatically. "
