ChatGPT can be a difficult testing grounds given that requests and responses can sometimes be more opaque than needed for debugging. Initial testing of your application through cURL or Postman to invoke the HTTP request from a more controlled environment will allow you to debug and triage issues more easily. Once you determine that responses are being returned as expected in those tools, you are ready to build your GPT."

    "* Files returned to ChatGPT are limited in size to 10MB. Your request may fail if the file returned is larger than that. Ensure to include LIMITs on your SQL commands if you find you are running into these limitations.\n",
    "* _Why is the Azure Function App requred in the first place?_ ChatGPT’s Data Analysis feature (aka Code Interpreter) depends on a secure Python environment that is separate from the model’s context window. Data passed to Data Analysis must be done so by uploading a file today. GPT actions returning data must then return that data as a CSV or other data file type. In order to return a file via GPT action, the response must be wrapped in an `openaiFileResponse` object. This requires custom code to properly format the response.\n",
    "* _My company uses a different cloud provider than Azure._ For connecting other middleware functions to ChatGPT via GPT action, please refer to other [AWS](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/chatgpt/gpt_actions_library/gpt_middleware_aws_function) or [GCP](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/chatgpt/gpt_actions_library/gpt_middleware_google_cloud_function) middleware cookbooks. You can use the concepts discussed in this cookbook to advise on considerations when building your middleware app, but connecting that middleware to Snowflake may be different for different cloud providers. For example, Snowflake built an External OAuth integration specifically for linking with Azure Entra ID. \n",
    "* _How do I limit the datasets that my GPT has access to?_ It can be imporant to limit the scope of access ChatGPT has within Snowflake. There are a few ways to do this:\n",
    "    * Snowflake roles can limit who has access to which tables, and will be respected by the GPT user’s access token provisioned by Azure Entra ID\n",
    "    * In your middleware function you can add sanity checks to verify the tables accessed are approved by for that application\n",
    "    * You may want to generate an entirely new Database/Warehouse specific to integrating with ChatGPT that is scrubbed of anything sensitive, such as PII.\n",
    "* _Schema calls the wrong warehouse or dataset:_ If ChatGPT calls the wrong warehouse or database, consider updating your instructions to make it more explicit either (a) which warehouse / database should be called or (b) to require the user provide those exact details before it runs the query"
