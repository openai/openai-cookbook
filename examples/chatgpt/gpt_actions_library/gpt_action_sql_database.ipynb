    "# GPT Action Library: SQL Database\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a guide for developers seeking to give ChatGPT the ability to query a SQL database using a GPT Action. Before reading this guide, please familiarize yourself with the following content:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* [Introduction to GPT Actions](https://platform.openai.com/docs/actions)\n",
    "* [Introduction to GPT Actions Library](https://platform.openai.com/docs/actions/actions-library)\n",
    "* [Example of Building a GPT Action from Scratch](https://platform.openai.com/docs/actions/getting-started)\n",
    "\n",
    "This guide outlines the workflow required to connect ChatGPT to a SQL Database via a middleware application. We’ll use a PostgreSQL database for this example, but the process should be similar for all SQL databases (MySQL, MS SQL Server, Amazon Aurora, SQL Server on Google Cloud, etc.). This documentation outlines the steps required to create GPT Action which can:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Execute read queries against a SQL Database\n",
    "* Return records via a text response\n",
    "* Return records via a CSV file\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Value + Example Business Use Cases\n",
    "\n",
    "**Value**: Users can now leverage ChatGPT's natural language capability to answer questions about data in a SQL database:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Business users can access information contained in a SQL database without writing SQL or submitting a request to an analyst\n",
    "* Data analysts can perform complex analysis beyond what is possible with a SQL query by extracting data and analyzing it with ChatGPT\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Use Cases**:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* A business user needs to answer questions about their sales funnel\n",
    "* A data analyst needs to perform a regression analysis on a large dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Application Design Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that most managed SQL databases do not provide REST APIs for submitting queries, you will need a middleware application to perform the following functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Accept database queries via REST API requests\n",
    "2. Forward queries to the integrated SQL database\n",
    "3. Convert database responses in to CSV files\n",
    "4. Return CSV files to the requestor\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main approaches to designing the first function:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The middleware supports a single method for receiving arbitrary SQL queries generated by the GPT and forwards them to the database. The benefits of this approach include:\n",
    "    1. Ease of development\n",
    "    2. Flexibility (doesn’t require you to anticipate the types of queries users will make)\n",
    "    3. Low maintenance (doesn’t require you to update the API schema in response to database changes)\n",
    "2. The middleware supports a number of methods corresponding to specific allowed queries. The benefits of this approach include:\n",
    "    4. More control\n",
    "    5. Less opportunity for model error when generating SQL\n",
    "\n",
    "This guide will focus on option 1. For those interested in option 2, consider implementing a service like [PostgREST](https://github.com/PostgREST/postgrest) or [Hasura](https://hasura.io/) to streamline the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "![An application architecture diagram depicting the interaction between the user, GPT, middleware, and database](../../../images/gptactions_sql_database_middleware.png)",
    "\n",
    "_Application architecture diagram_\n",
    "\n",
    "## Middleware Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "Developers can either build custom middleware (commonly deployed as serverless functions with CSPs like AWS, GCP, or MS Azure) or use third-party solutions (like [Mulesoft Anypoint](https://www.mulesoft.com/platform/enterprise-integration) or [Retool Workflows](https://retool.com/products/workflows)). Using third-party middleware can accelerate your development process, but is less flexible than building it yourself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Building your own middleware gives you more control over the application’s behavior. For an example of custom middleware, see our [Azure Functions cookbook](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/chatgpt/gpt_actions_library/gpt_middleware_azure_function).\n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than focusing on the specifics of middleware setup, this guide will focus on the middleware’s interface with the GPT and SQL database.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Workflow Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1) GPT generates a SQL query\n",
    "\n",
    "GPTs are very good at writing SQL queries based on a user’s natural language prompt. You can improve the GPT’s query generation capabilities by giving it access to the database schema in one of the following ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Instruct the GPT to start by querying the database to retrieve the schema (this approach is demonstrated in more detail in our [BigQuery cookbook](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/chatgpt/gpt_actions_library/gpt_action_bigquery#custom-gpt-instructions)).\n",
    "2. Provide the schema in the GPT instructions (works best for small, static schemata)\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are sample GPT instructions which include information about a simple database schema:\n"

    "**A note on authentication:** The API interface in the above example accepts a single system-level API key which is stored along with the GPT’s configuration and used to authenticate requests for all GPT users. GPT Actions also support OAuth authentication, which enables user-level authentication and authorization. [Learn more about GPT Action authentication options](https://platform.openai.com/docs/actions/authentication).\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the user is authenticating with middleware and not directly with the underlying database, enforcing user-level access (table or row-level permissions) requires more effort. However, it may be required for GPTs where users have different levels of access to the underlying database.\n",
    "\n",
    " In order to enforce user-level permissions, your middleware should:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Receive the user’s metadata provided by the IdP during the OAuth flow and extract their identifying information\n",
    "2. Query the database to retrieve the user’s database permissions\n",
    "3. Issue a command to the database to enforce the relevant permissions for the remainder of the session\n",

    "In order to maintain a good user experience, you’ll want to dynamically retrieve the available database schema for each user as opposed to including the schema data in the GPT instructions directly. This ensures that the GPT only has access to tables which it can query on behalf of the current user.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3) Middleware forwards SQL query to database \n",
    "\n",
    "Your middleware will implement a database driver or client library to enable it to query the PostgreSQL database directly. If you are using third-party middleware, the middleware vendor should provide native connectors for SQL databases. If you are building your own middleware, you may need to implement a client library provided by the database vendor or a third-party. For example, here is a list of community-maintained client libraries for PostgreSQL: [https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/List_of_drivers](https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/List_of_drivers)\n",

This ensures that the AI-generated queries cannot insert new data or modify existing data. If write access is required for your use-case, consider deploying operation-specific endpoints rather than accepting arbitrary SQL.\n",

    "### 4) Database returns records to middleware\n",
    "\n",
