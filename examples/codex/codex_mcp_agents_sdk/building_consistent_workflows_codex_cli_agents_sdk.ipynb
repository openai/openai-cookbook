    "# Building Consistent Workflows with Codex CLI & Agents SDK\n",
    "### Ensuring Repeatable, Traceable, and Scaleable Agentic Development\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "Developers strive for consistency in everything they do. With Codex CLI and the Agents SDK, that consistency can now scale like never before. Whether you’re refactoring a large codebase, rolling out new features, or introducing a new testing framework, Codex integrates seamlessly into CLI, IDE, and cloud workflows to automate and enforce repeatable development patterns.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In this track, we’ll build both single and multi-agent systems using the Agents SDK, with Codex CLI exposed as an MCP Server. This enables:  \n",
    "- **Consistency and Repeatability** by providing each agent a scoped context.  \n",
    "- **Scalable Orchestration** to coordinate single and multi-agent systems.  \n",
    "- **Observability & Auditability** by reviewing the full agentic stack trace.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## What We’ll Cover\n",
    "- Initializing Codex CLI as an MCP Server: How to run Codex as a long-running MCP process.  \n",
    "- Building Single-Agent Systems: Using Codex MCP for scoped tasks.  \n",
    "- Orchestrating Multi-Agent Workflows: Coordinating multiple specialized agents.  \n",
    "- Tracing Agentic Behavior: Leveraging agent traces for visibility and evaluation.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites & Setup\n",
    "Before starting this track, ensure you have the following:  \n",
    "- Basic coding familiarity: You should be comfortable with Python and JavaScript.  \n",
    "- Developer environment: You’ll need an IDE, like VS Code or Cursor.  \n",
    "- OpenAI API key: Create or find your API key in the OpenAI Dashboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Environment Setup\n",
    "1. create a `.env` folder in your directory and add your `OPENAI_API_KEY` Key\n",
    "2. Install dependencies\n"

    "In this guide, we walked through the process of building consistent, scalable workflows using Codex CLI and the Agents SDK. Specifically, we covered:  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Codex MCP Server Setup** – How to initialize Codex CLI as an MCP server and make it available as tools for agent interactions.  \n",
    "- **Single-Agent Example** – A simple workflow with a Designer Agent and a Developer Agent, where Codex executed scoped tasks deterministically to produce a playable game.  \n",
    "- **Multi-Agent Orchestration** – Expanding to a larger workflow with a Project Manager, Designer, Frontend Developer, Backend Developer, and Tester, mirroring complex task orchestration and sign-off processes.  \n",
    "- **Traces & Observability** – Using built-in Traces to capture prompts, tool calls, handoffs, execution times, and artifacts, giving full visibility into agentic behavior for debugging, evaluation, and future optimization.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Moving Forward: Applying These Lessons\n",
    "Now that you’ve seen Codex MCP and the Agents SDK in action, here’s how you can apply the concepts in real projects and extract value:  \n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Scale to Real-World Rollouts\n",
    "- Apply the same multi-agent orchestration to large code refactors (e.g., 500+ files, framework migrations).  \n",
    "- Use Codex MCP’s deterministic execution for long-running, auditable rollouts with traceable progress.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Accelerate Delivery Without Losing Control\n",
    "- Organize teams of specialized agents to parallelize development, while maintaining gating logic for artifact validation.  \n",
    "- Reduce turnaround time for new features, testing, or codebase modernization.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Extend and Connect to Your Development Workflows\n",
    "- Connect MCP-powered agents with Jira, GitHub, or CI/CD pipelines via webhooks for automated, repeatable development cycles.  \n",
    "- Leverage Codex MCP in multi-agent service orchestration: not just codegen, but also documentation, QA, and deployment.  \n"
