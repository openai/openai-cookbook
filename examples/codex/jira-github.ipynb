        "\n",
        "This cookbook provides a practical, step-by-step approach to automating the workflow between Jira and GitHub. By labeling a Jira issue, you trigger an end-to-end process that creates a **GitHub pull request**, keeps both systems updated, and streamlines code review, all with minimal manual effort. The automation is powered by the [`codex-cli`](https://github.com/openai/openai-codex) agent running inside a GitHub Action.\n",

        "1. Label a Jira issue \n",

        "3. The action spins up `codex-cli` to implement the change \n",
        "4. A PR is opened\n",
        "5. Jira is transitioned & annotated - creating a neat, zero-click loop. This includes changing the status of the ticket, adding the PR link and commenting in the ticket with updates.\n",

        "Next, we check whether the updated labels include a specific keyword, in our example we are using `aswe`. This acts as a filter so that only issues explicitly tagged for automation proceed, avoiding unnecessary noise from unrelated updates.\n",
        "\n",
        "If the condition is met, we send a `POST` request to GitHub’s `workflow_dispatch` endpoint. This kicks off a GitHub Actions workflow with the relevant issue context. We pass in the issue key, summary, and a cleaned-up version of the description—escaping quotes and newlines so the payload parses correctly in YAML/JSON. There are [additional fields](https://support.atlassian.com/cloud-automation/docs/jira-smart-values-issues/) available as variables in JIRA to give the codex agent more context during its execution.\n",
