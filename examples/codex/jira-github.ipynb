        "\n",
        "This cookbook provides a practical, step-by-step approach to automating the workflow between Jira and GitHub. By labeling a Jira issue, you trigger an end-to-end process that creates a **GitHub pull request**, keeps both systems updated, and streamlines code review, all with minimal manual effort. The automation is powered by the [`codex-cli`](https://github.com/openai/openai-codex) agent running inside a GitHub Action.\n",

        "1. Label a Jira issue \n",
        "2. Jira Automation calls the GitHub Action \n",
        "3. The action spins up `codex-cli` to implement the change \n",
        "4. A PR is opened\n",
        "5. Jira is transitioned & annotated - creating a neat, zero-click loop. This includes changing the status of the ticket, adding the PR link and commenting in the ticket with updates.\n",

        "\n",
        "Next, we check whether the updated labels include a specific keyword, in our example we are using `aswe`. This acts as a filter so that only issues explicitly tagged for automation proceed, avoiding unnecessary noise from unrelated updates.\n",
        "\n",
        "If the condition is met, we send a `POST` request to GitHub’s `workflow_dispatch` endpoint. This kicks off a GitHub Actions workflow with the relevant issue context. We pass in the issue key, summary, and a cleaned-up version of the description—escaping quotes and newlines so the payload parses correctly in YAML/JSON. There are [additional fields](https://support.atlassian.com/cloud-automation/docs/jira-smart-values-issues/) available as variables in JIRA to give the codex agent more context during its execution.\n",
        "\n",
        "This setup allows teams to tightly control which Jira issues trigger automation, and ensures GitHub receives structured, clean metadata to act on. We can also set up multiple labels, each triggering a different GitHub Action.
