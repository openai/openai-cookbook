It's the 'NOTE' you need to read and verify if the course has any restrictions. If not, you can take the course and have it count in your program.

You are correct about the number of credits for a Bachelor of Fine Arts. Applicants must complete 90 credits in their program in order to graduate. In the Computation Arts program the core is comprised of 66 credits and 24 electives and the breakdown is like this:
COMPUTATION ARTS - SPECIALIZATION
FFAR 250 (6 cr) all F.A. students are obliged to pass.
60 cr. Computation Arts core and electives
6 cr. Outside the faculty courses
18 cr. free electives (any courses in or out of the faculty)
You can see the details in this document which is your Program Guide: http://www.concordia.ca/content/dam/finearts/docs/program-guides/2016/2017/Program%20Guides%202018/Programguides2019/ProgramGuides/CART-spec-F20.pdf
Transfer Credits:
If you read your Offer of Admission you'll see the transfer credits where awarded to you with a code 
GEN L = general elective: can be placed at the top or bottom as free electives on the program guide
GFAR = General Fine Arts: can be placed where you have to take a fine arts elective
SFAR = Studio Fine Arts: can be placed where you take studio fine arts courses or be a course substitute for a course you took in your previous university. This depends on if the course you passed is similar in course content to the course our department is offering. You must also proof this with documentation from the course you took i.e. course outline, assignments, projects etc. This is completed with a SRF (Student Request form — Course Substitution). Students must write a rationale for this request and show documentation (your course outline vs our course description in a Word document) along with attached assignments/projects/etc.

In most cases, student will have GEN L transfer credits which will be applied to “Free Electives” or GFAR (Fine Arts Electives) which are used for Fine Arts electives.  If you have relevant documentation to prove that the course you took in your previous institution is very similar and equal in academic value to one of our core courses, you can request an appointment to meet with the chair of the department via the Department Assistant (designandcoomputationarts@concordia.ca). 
You should not make an appointment with the chair/UGPD unless you have all your documentation ready (course outline, projects, assignments etc). Our UGPD's can only make an assessment of your request if you provide documentation. Once approved, they will explain the next step in the process.  
Once you've looked at your Program Guide, you'll be able to see where some of your transfer credits can be applied. We ask our students to use the Program Guide and always update and save it as they move forward in their program. We need this document sent to the department when requesting help with registration so please keep this document handy (computer/phone). It is helpful to you and to us in getting you registered quickly.

First Year Courses:
In your Offer of Admission, you were provided with a link that would give you the “Recommended Courses” for your first year plus some electives. You also had the choice to take courses as a “full-time” or “part-time” student. http://www.concordia.ca/finearts/students/sas/new-students-advising-registration.html 
If you have problems with registering you can join the Zoom Meetings that are indicated on this website.
