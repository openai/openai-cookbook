# Developer quickstart

## Get up and running with the OpenAI API


    Looking for ChatGPT? Head to chatgpt.com.


The OpenAI API provides a simple interface for developers to create an intelligence layer in their applications, powered by OpenAI's state of the art models. The Chat Completions endpoint powers ChatGPT and provides a simple way to take text as input and use a model like GPT-4o to generate an output.

        Skip the quickstart and dive into the API reference.
    




This quickstart is designed to help get your local development environment set up and send your first API request. If you are an experienced developer or want to just dive into using the OpenAI API, the [API reference](/docs/api-reference) of [GPT guide](/docs/guides/text-generation) are a great place to start. Throughout this quickstart, you will learn:

-   How to set up your development environment
-   How to install the latest SDKs
-   Some of the basic concepts of the OpenAI API
-   How to send your first API request

If you run into any challenges or have questions getting started, please join our [developer forum](https://community.openai.com).

## Account setup

First, create an [OpenAI account](/signup) or [sign in](/login). Next, navigate to the [API key page](/account/api-keys) and "Create new secret key", optionally naming the key. Make sure to save this somewhere safe and do not share it with anyone.
