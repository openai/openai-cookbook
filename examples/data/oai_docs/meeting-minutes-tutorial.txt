# Creating an automated meeting minutes generator with Whisper and GPT-4

In this tutorial, we'll harness the power of OpenAI's Whisper and GPT-4 models to develop an automated meeting minutes generator. The application transcribes audio from a meeting, provides a summary of the discussion, extracts key points and action items, and performs a sentiment analysis.

## Getting started

This tutorial assumes a basic understanding of Python and an [OpenAI API key](/account/api-keys). You can use the audio file provided with this tutorial or your own.

Additionally, you will need to install the [python-docx](https://python-docx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [OpenAI](/docs/libraries/libraries) libraries. You can create a new Python environment and install the required packages with the following commands:

```bash
python -m venv env

source env/bin/activate

pip install openai
pip install python-docx
```

## Transcribing audio with Whisper

            The first step in transcribing the audio from a meeting is to pass the audio
            file of the meeting into our{" "}
            /v1/audio API. Whisper, the model that
            powers the audio API, is capable of converting spoken language into written
            text. To start, we will avoid passing a{" "}
            
                prompt
            {" "}
            or{" "}
            
                temperature
            {" "}
            (optional parameters to control the model's output) and stick with the default
            values.
        
        
            <Button
                size="medium"

                target="_blank"
            >
                Download sample audio
            
        
    




Next, we import the required packages and define a function that uses the Whisper model to take in the audio file and
transcribe it:

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
    # defaults to os.environ.get("OPENAI_API_KEY")
    # api_key="My API Key",
)
from docx import Document

def transcribe_audio(audio_file_path):
    with open(audio_file_path, 'rb') as audio_file:
        transcription = client.audio.transcriptions.create("whisper-1", audio_file)
    return transcription['text']
```

In this function, `audio_file_path` is the path to the audio file you want to transcribe. The function opens this file and passes it to the Whisper ASR model (`whisper-1`) for transcription. The result is returned as raw text. It’s important to note that the `openai.Audio.transcribe` function requires the actual audio file to be passed in, not just the path to the file locally or on a remote server. This means that if you are running this code on a server where you might not also be storing your audio files, you will need to have a preprocessing step that first downloads the audio files onto that device.

## Summarizing and analyzing the transcript with GPT-4

Having obtained the transcript, we now pass it to GPT-4 via the [Chat Completions API](/docs/api-reference/chat/create). GPT-4 is OpenAI's state-of-the-art large language model which we'll use to generate a summary, extract key points, action items, and perform sentiment analysis.

This tutorial uses distinct functions for each task we want GPT-4 to perform. This is not the most efficient way to do this task - you can put these instructions into one function, however, splitting them up can lead to higher quality summarization.

To split the tasks up, we define the `meeting_minutes` function which will serve as the main function of this application:

```python
def meeting_minutes(transcription):
    abstract_summary = abstract_summary_extraction(transcription)
    key_points = key_points_extraction(transcription)
    action_items = action_item_extraction(transcription)
    sentiment = sentiment_analysis(transcription)
    return {
        'abstract_summary': abstract_summary,
        'key_points': key_points,
        'action_items': action_items,
        'sentiment': sentiment
    }
```

In this function, `transcription` is the text we obtained from Whisper. The transcription can be passed to the four other functions, each designed to perform a specific task: `abstract_summary_extraction` generates a summary of the meeting, `key_points_extraction` extracts the main points, `action_item_extraction` identifies the action items, and `sentiment_analysis performs` a sentiment analysis. If there are other capabilities you want, you can add those in as well using the same framework shown above.

Here is how each of these functions works:

### Summary extraction

The `abstract_summary_extraction` function takes the transcription and summarizes it into a concise abstract paragraph with the aim to retain the most important points while avoiding unnecessary details or tangential points. The main mechanism to enable this process is the system message as shown below. There are many different possible ways of achieving similar results through the process commonly referred to as prompt engineering. You can read our [prompt engineering guide](/docs/guides/prompt-engineering) which gives in depth advice on how to do this most effectively.

```python
def abstract_summary_extraction(transcription):
    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4",
        temperature=0,
        messages=[
            {
                "role": "system",
                "content": "You are a highly skilled AI trained in language comprehension and summarization. I would like you to read the following text and summarize it into a concise abstract paragraph. Aim to retain the most important points, providing a coherent and readable summary that could help a person understand the main points of the discussion without needing to read the entire text. Please avoid unnecessary details or tangential points."
            },
            {
                "role": "user",
                "content": transcription
            }
        ]
    )
    return completion.choices[0].message.content
```

### Key points extraction

The `key_points_extraction` function identifies and lists the main points discussed in the meeting. These points should represent the most important ideas, findings, or topics crucial to the essence of the discussion. Again, the main mechanism for controlling the way these points are identified is the system message. You might want to give some additional context here around the way your project or company runs such as “We are a company that sells race cars to consumers. We do XYZ with the goal of XYZ”. This additional context could dramatically improve the models ability to extract information that is relevant.

```python

def key_points_extraction(transcription):
    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4",
        temperature=0,
        messages=[
            {
                "role": "system",
                "content": "You are a proficient AI with a specialty in distilling information into key points. Based on the following text, identify and list the main points that were discussed or brought up. These should be the most important ideas, findings, or topics that are crucial to the essence of the discussion. Your goal is to provide a list that someone could read to quickly understand what was talked about."
            },
            {
                "role": "user",
                "content": transcription
            }
        ]
    )
    return completion.choices[0].message.content
```

### Action item extraction

The `action_item_extraction` function identifies tasks, assignments, or actions agreed upon or mentioned during the meeting. These could be tasks assigned to specific individuals or general actions the group decided to take. While not covered in this tutorial, the Chat Completions API provides a [function calling capability](/docs/guides/function-calling) which would allow you to build in the ability to automatically create tasks in your task management software and assign it to the relevant person.

```python

def action_item_extraction(transcription):
    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4",
        temperature=0,
        messages=[
            {
                "role": "system",
                "content": "You are an AI expert in analyzing conversations and extracting action items. Please review the text and identify any tasks, assignments, or actions that were agreed upon or mentioned as needing to be done. These could be tasks assigned to specific individuals, or general actions that the group has decided to take. Please list these action items clearly and concisely."
            },
            {
                "role": "user",
                "content": transcription
            }
        ]
    )
    return completion.choices[0].message.content
```

### Sentiment analysis

The `sentiment_analysis` function analyzes the overall sentiment of the discussion. It considers the tone, the emotions conveyed by the language used, and the context in which words and phrases are used. For tasks which are less complicated, it may also be worthwhile to try out `gpt-3.5-turbo` in addition to `gpt-4` to see if you can get a similar level of performance. It might also be useful to experiment with taking the results of the `sentiment_analysis` function and passing it to the other functions to see how having the sentiment of the conversation impacts the other attributes.

```python
def sentiment_analysis(transcription):
    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4",
        temperature=0,
        messages=[
            {
                "role": "system",
                "content": "As an AI with expertise in language and emotion analysis, your task is to analyze the sentiment of the following text. Please consider the overall tone of the discussion, the emotion conveyed by the language used, and the context in which words and phrases are used. Indicate whether the sentiment is generally positive, negative, or neutral, and provide brief explanations for your analysis where possible."
            },
            {
                "role": "user",
                "content": transcription
            }
        ]
    )
    return completion.choices[0].message.content
```

## Exporting meeting minutes


    
        <Image

            webp="https://cdn.openai.com/API/docs/images/tutorials/meeting-minutes/waveform4.webp"
            alt="Audio Waveform created by DALL·E"
            width="1024"
            height="1024"
        />
    
    
        
            Once we've generated the meeting minutes, it's beneficial to save them into a
            readable format that can be easily distributed. One common format for such
            reports is Microsoft Word. The Python docx library is a popular open source
            library for creating Word documents. If you wanted to build an end-to-end
            meeting minute application, you might consider removing this export step in
            favor of sending the summary inline as an email followup.
        
    




To handle the exporting process, define a function `save_as_docx` that converts the raw text to a Word document:

```python
def save_as_docx(minutes, filename):
    doc = Document()
    for key, value in minutes.items():
        # Replace underscores with spaces and capitalize each word for the heading
        heading = ' '.join(word.capitalize() for word in key.split('_'))
        doc.add_heading(heading, level=1)
        doc.add_paragraph(value)
        # Add a line break between sections
        doc.add_paragraph()
    doc.save(filename)
```

In this function, minutes is a dictionary containing the abstract summary, key points, action items, and sentiment analysis from the meeting. Filename is the name of the Word document file to be created. The function creates a new Word document, adds headings and content for each part of the minutes, and then saves the document to the current working directory.

Finally, you can put it all together and generate the meeting minutes from an audio file:

```python
audio_file_path = "Earningscall.wav"
transcription = transcribe_audio(audio_file_path)
minutes = meeting_minutes(transcription)
print(minutes)

save_as_docx(minutes, 'meeting_minutes.docx')
```

This code will transcribe the audio file `Earningscall.wav`, generates the meeting minutes, prints them, and then saves them into a Word document called `meeting_minutes.docx`.

Now that you have the basic meeting minutes processing setup, consider trying to optimize the performance with [prompt engineering](/docs/guides/prompt-engineering) or build an end-to-end system with native [function calling](/docs/guides/function-calling).
