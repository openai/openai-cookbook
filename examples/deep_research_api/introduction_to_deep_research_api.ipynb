        "The Deep Research API enables you to automate complex research workflows that require reasoning, planning, and synthesis across real-world information. It is designed to take a high-level query and return a structured, citation-rich report by leveraging an agentic model capable of decomposing the task, performing web searches, and synthesizing results.\n",
        "\n",
        "Unlike ChatGPT where this process is abstracted away, the API provides direct programmatic access. When you send a request, the model autonomously plans sub-questions, uses tools like web search and code execution, and produces a final structured response. This cookbook will provide a brief introduction to the Deep Research API and how to use it.\n",

        "## Clarifying Questions in ChatGPT vs. the Deep Research API\n",
        "If you’ve used Deep Research in ChatGPT, you may have noticed that it often asks follow-up questions after you submit a query. This is intentional: ChatGPT uses an intermediate model (like gpt-4.1) to help clarify your intent and gather more context (such as your preferences, goals, or constraints) before the research process begins. This extra step helps the system tailor its web searches and return more relevant and targeted results.\n",
        "\n",
        "In contrast, the Deep Research API skips this clarification step. As a developer, you can configure this processing step to rewrite the user prompt or ask a set of clarifying questions, since the model expects fully-formed prompts up front and will not ask for additional context or fill in missing information; it simply starts researching based on the input it receives.\n",
        "\n",
        "To get strong, reliable outputs from the API, you can use two approaches.\n",
        "- Use a prompt rewriter using another lightweight model (e.g., gpt-4.1) to expand or specify user queries before passing them to the research model.\n",
        "- Include all relevant details: desired scope, comparisons, metrics, regions, preferred sources, and expected output format.\n",
        "\n",
        "This setup gives developers full control over how research tasks are framed, but also places greater responsibility on the quality of the input prompt. Here's an example of a generic rewriting_prompt to better direct the subsequent deep research query.\n",

        "You will be given a research task by a user. Your job is to produce a set of instructions for a researcher that will complete the task. Do NOT complete the task yourself, just provide instructions on how to complete it.\n",
        "\n",
        "GUIDELINES:\n",
        "1. **Maximize Specificity and Detail**\n",
        "- Include all known user preferences and explicitly list key attributes or dimensions to consider.\n",
        "- It is of utmost importance that all details from the user are included in the instructions.\n",

        "2. **Fill in Unstated But Necessary Dimensions as Open-Ended**\n",
        "- If certain attributes are essential for a meaningful output but the user has not provided them, explicitly state that they are open-ended or default to no specific constraint.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Avoid Unwarranted Assumptions**\n",
        "- If the user has not provided a particular detail, do not invent one.\n",
        "- Instead, state the lack of specification and guide the researcher to treat it as flexible or accept all possible options.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Use the First Person**\n",
        "- Phrase the request from the perspective of the user.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Tables**\n",
        "- If you determine that including a table will help illustrate, organize, or enhance the information in the research output, you must explicitly request that the researcher provide them.\n",
        "Examples:\n",
        "- Product Comparison (Consumer): When comparing different smartphone models, request a table listing each model's features, price, and consumer ratings side-by-side.\n",
        "- Project Tracking (Work): When outlining project deliverables, create a table showing tasks, deadlines, responsible team members, and status updates.\n",
        "- Budget Planning (Consumer): When creating a personal or household budget, request a table detailing income sources, monthly expenses, and savings goals.\n",
        "Competitor Analysis (Work): When evaluating competitor products, request a table with key metrics, such as market share, pricing, and main differentiators.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Headers and Formatting**\n",
        "- You should include the expected output format in the prompt.\n",
        "- If the user is asking for content that would be best returned in a structured format (e.g. a report, plan, etc.), ask the researcher to format as a report with the appropriate headers and formatting that ensures clarity and structure.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. **Language**\n",
        "- If the user input is in a language other than English, tell the researcher to respond in this language, unless the user query explicitly asks for the response in a different language.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. **Sources**\n",
        "- If specific sources should be prioritized, specify them in the prompt.\n",
        "- For product and travel research, prefer linking directly to official or primary websites (e.g., official brand sites, manufacturer pages, or reputable e-commerce platforms like Amazon for user reviews) rather than aggregator sites or SEO-heavy blogs.\n",
        "- For academic or scientific queries, prefer linking directly to the original paper or official journal publication rather than survey papers or secondary summaries.\n",
