    "# How to evaluate a summarization task\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we delve into the evaluation techniques for abstractive summarization tasks using a simple example. We explore traditional evaluation methods like [ROUGE](https://aclanthology.org/W04-1013/) and [BERTScore](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.09675), in addition to showcasing a more novel approach using LLMs as evaluators.\n",
    "\n",
    "Evaluating the quality of summaries is a time-consuming process, as it involves different quality metrics such as coherence, conciseness, readability and content. Traditional automatic evaluation metrics such as `ROUGE` and `BERTScore` and others are concrete and reliable, but they may not correlate well with the actual quality of summaries. They show relatively low correlation with human judgments, especially for open-ended generation tasks ([Liu et al., 2023](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.16634.pdf)). There's a growing need to lean on human evaluations, user feedback, or model-based metrics while being vigilant about potential biases. While human judgment provides invaluable insights, it is often not scalable and can be cost-prohibitive.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to these traditional metrics, we showcase a method ([G-Eval](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.16634.pdf)) that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) as a novel, reference-free metric for assessing abstractive summaries. In this case, we use `gpt-4` to score candidate outputs. `gpt-4` has effectively learned an internal model of language quality that allows it to differentiate between fluent, coherent text and low-quality text. Harnessing this internal scoring mechanism allows auto-evaluation of new candidate outputs generated by an LLM.\n"

    "The table shows the `ROUGE` scores for evaluating two different summaries against a reference text. In the case of `rouge-1`, Summary 2 outperforms Summary 1, indicating a better overlap of individual words and for `rouge-l`, Summary 2 has a higher score, implying a closer match in the longest common subsequences, and thus a potentially better overall summarization in capturing the main content and order of the original text. Since Summary 2 has many words and short phrases directly lifted from the excerpt, its overlap with the reference summary would likely be higher, leading to higher `ROUGE` scores.\n",

They also correlate worse with human scores. Given the advancements in LLMs, which are adept at producing fluent and coherent summaries, traditional metrics like `ROUGE` may inadvertently penalize these models. This is especially true if the summaries are articulated differently but still encapsulate the core information accurately.\n"

Unlike metrics like `ROUGE` or `BERTScore` that rely on comparison to reference summaries, the `gpt-4` based evaluator assesses the quality of generated content based solely on the input prompt and text, without any ground truth references. This makes it applicable to new datasets and tasks where human references are sparse or unavailable. \n",

    "    4. **Fluency**: Rates the grammar and readability of the summary.\n",

    "### Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that LLM-based metrics could have a bias towards preferring LLM-generated texts over human-written texts. Additionally LLM based metrics are sensitive to system messages/prompts. We recommend experimenting with other techniques that can help improve performance and/or get consistent scores, striking the right balance between high-quality expensive evaluation and automated evaluations. It is also worth noting that this scoring methodology is currently limited by `gpt-4`'s context window.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Evaluating abstractive summarization remains an open area for further improvement. Traditional metrics like `ROUGE`, `BLEU`, and `BERTScore` provide useful automatic evaluation but have limitations in capturing semantic similarity and nuanced aspects of summarization quality. Moreover, they require reference outputs which can be expensive to collect/label. LLM-based metrics offer promise as a reference-free method of evaluating coherence, fluency, and relevance. However, they too have potential biases favoring text generated by LLMs. Ultimately, a combination of automatic metrics and human evaluation is ideal for reliably assessing abstractive summarization systems. While human evaluation is indispensable for gaining a comprehensive understanding of summary quality, it should be complemented with automated evaluation to enable efficient, large-scale testing. The field will continue to evolve more robust evaluation techniques, balancing quality, scalability, and fairness. Advancing evaluation methods is crucial for driving progress in production applications.\n",
