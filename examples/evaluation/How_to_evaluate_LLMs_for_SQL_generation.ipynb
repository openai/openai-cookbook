    "# How to test and evaluate LLMs for SQL generation\n",
    "\n",
    "LLMs are fundamentatlly non-deterministic in their responses, this attribute makes them wonderfully creative and dynamic in their responses. However, this trait poses significant challenges in achieving consistency, a crucial aspect for integrating LLMs into production environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key to harnessing the potential of LLMs in practical applications lies in consistent and systematic evaluation. This enables the identification and rectification of inconsistencies and helps in monitoring progress over time as the application evolves.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scope of this notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook aims to demonstrate a framework for evaluating LLMs, particularly focusing on:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Unit Testing:** Essential for assessing individual components of the application.\n",
    "* **Evaluation Metrics:** Methods to quantitatively measure the model's effectiveness.\n",
    "* **Runbook Documentation:** A record of historical evaluations to track progress and regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "This example focuses on a natural language to SQL use case - code generation use cases fit well with this approach when you combine **code validation** with **code execution**, so your application can test code for real as it is generated to ensure consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although this notebook uses SQL generation usecase to demonstrate the concept, the approach is generic and can be applied to a wide variety of LLM driven applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use two versions of a prompt to perform SQL generation.  We will then use the unit tests and evaluation functions to test the perforamance of the prompts.  Specifically, in this demonstration, we will evaluate:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The consistency of JSON response.\n",
    "2. Syntactic correctness of SQL in response.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Table of contents\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **[Setup](#Setup):** Install required libraries, download data consisting of SQL queries and corresponding natural language translations.\n",
    "2. **[Test Development](#Test-development):** Create unit tests and define evaluation metrics for the SQL generation process.\n",
    "4. **[Evaluation](#Evaluation):** Conduct tests using different prompts to assess the impact on performance.\n",
    "5. **[Reporting](#Report):** Compile a report that succinctly presents the performance differences observed across various tests."

    "Now you have a framework to test SQL generation using LLMs, and with some tweaks this approach can be extended to many other code generation use cases. With GPT-4 and engaged human labellers you can aim to automate the evaluation of these test cases, making an iterative loop where new examples are added to the test set and this structure detects any performance regressions. \n",
