    "In this cookbook, we'll walk through an image example with the Evals API. More specifically, we will use Evals API to evaluate model-generated responses to an image and its corresponding prompt, using **sampling** to generate model responses and **model grading** (LLM as a Judge) to score those model responses against the image and reference answer.\n",
