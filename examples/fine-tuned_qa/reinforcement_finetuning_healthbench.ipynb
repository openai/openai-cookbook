    "# Reinforcement Fine-Tuning with the OpenAI API for Conversational Reasoning\n",
    "\n",
    "*This guide is for developers and ML practitioners who have some experience with OpenAIʼs APIs and wish to use their fine-tuned models for research or other appropriate uses. OpenAI’s services are not intended for the personalized treatment or diagnosis of any medical condition and are subject to our [applicable terms](https://openai.com/policies/).*\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to use OpenAI's reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) to improve a model's conversational reasoning capabilities (specifically asking questions to gain additional context and reduce uncertainty). RFT allows you to train models using reinforcement learning techniques, rewarding or penalizing responses based on specific criteria. This approach is particularly useful for enhancing dialogue systems, where the quality of reasoning and context understanding is crucial.\n",

Gentle Stretching and Strengthening (after pain decreases)  \\n- When the pain subsides, start gentle stretching and strengthening exercises for the groin and surrounding muscles.\\n- Avoid returning to full activity until you can move your leg without pain.\\n\\n### 7.

      "Response: [{'content': 'I understand you want a clear, definite answer. However, **knee clicking** (also called \"crepitus\") when climbing stairs can be caused by several different things, and it\\'s not possible to give a 100% certain answer without a physical examination or imaging. But, the **most common definite cause** in adults is:\\n\\n### **Cartilage changes under the kneecap (patellofemoral joint)**\\n\\nAs you bend your knee climbing stairs, the kneecap (patella) moves over the thigh bone (femur). If the cartilage is slightly roughened, worn, or uneven—often due to normal aging, mild wear-and-tear, or previous minor injuries—it can cause a clicking or grinding sound. This is called **chondromalacia patellae** or early patellofemoral osteoarthritis.\\n\\n**Key points:**\\n- If you have no pain, swelling, or instability, this is almost always benign.\\n- If you have pain, swelling, or your knee feels like it catches or gives way, see a doctor.\\n\\n**Other possible causes include:**\\n- Tendons or ligaments snapping over bony prominences\\n- Meniscus (cartilage pad) issues\\n- Loose bodies (rare)\\n\\n**Bottom line:**  \\nThe most definite, common cause for knee clicking climbing stairs is **roughened cartilage under the kneecap** (patellofemoral crepitus), especially if there is no pain.\\n\\nIf you want a 100% definite diagnosis for your specific knee, you need an in-person assessment by a healthcare professional.', 'role': 'assistant'}]\n",
      "Score: 2.5\n",
      "Explanation: The assistant does not seek any additional context or ask follow-up questions to reduce uncertainty. Although it explains the most common cause and mentions that a definite diagnosis requires an in-person assessment, it does not ask for more information about the user's symptoms (such as pain, swelling, history of injury, age, activity level, etc.) or suggest what additional information would be helpful. Therefore, the criteria are not met.\n",

The severity of the injury matters, so if you have severe pain, swelling, bruising, or trouble walking, it's best to consult a healthcare professional.\\n\\n**For mild to moderate groin pulls, here are some next steps:**\\n\\n### 1. Rest  \\n- Avoid activities that cause pain, especially dancing or exercises that strain the groin.\\n\\n### 2. Ice  \\n- Apply an ice pack (wrapped in a towel) to the injured area for 15-20 minutes every 2-3 hours during the first 48 hours.\\n\\n### 3. Compression  \\n- Use a compression bandage or shorts to help reduce swelling.\\n\\n### 4. Elevation  \\n- If possible, lie down and elevate your legs to help decrease swelling.\\n\\n### 5. Pain Relief  \\n- Over-the-counter pain relievers like acetaminophen or ibuprofen can help with pain and inflammation (use as directed).\\n\\n### 6. Gentle Stretching and Strengthening (after pain decreases)  \\n- When the pain subsides, start gentle stretching and strengthening exercises for the groin and surrounding muscles.\\n- Avoid returning to full activity until you can move your leg without pain.\\n\\n### 7. Gradual Return  \\n- Ease back into dancing or sports slowly. If you feel pain, stop and rest.\\n\\n### 8. Seek Medical Attention If:\\n- The pain is severe or persistent\\n- You are unable to walk\\n- There is significant swelling, bruising, or a popping sound at the time of injury\\n\\n**Remember:** Healing can take from a few days to several weeks depending on the severity. If you’re unsure about the severity, or if you’re not improving, consult a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and treatment plan.\\n\\nWould you like tips for specific stretches or exercises for recovery?\", 'role': 'assistant'}]\n",

      "Explanation: The assistant does seek some additional context by asking, 'Would you like tips for specific stretches or exercises for recovery?' However, this is a relatively narrow follow-up and does not broadly seek more informative or useful context about the user's injury, such as the severity, duration, or any specific symptoms. The rubric requires seeking the most informative or useful context, which could include asking about pain level, ability to walk, how long ago the injury occurred, or other relevant details.
