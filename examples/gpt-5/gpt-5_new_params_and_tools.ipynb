    "#  GPT-5 New Params and Tools\n",
    "\n",
    "We’re introducing new developer controls in the GPT-5 series that give you greater control over model responses—from shaping output length and style to enforcing strict formatting. Below is a quick overview of the latest features:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "| #  | Feature | Overview | Values / Usage |\n",
    "|----|---------|----------|----------------|\n",
    "| 1. | **Verbosity Parameter** | Lets you hint the model to be more or less expansive in its replies. Keep prompts stable and use the parameter instead of re-writing. | • **low** → terse UX, minimal prose.<br>• **medium** *(default)* → balanced detail.<br>• **high** → verbose, great for audits, teaching, or hand-offs. |\n",
    "| 2. | **Freeform Function Calling** | Generate raw text payloads—anything from Python scripts to SQL queries—directly to your custom tool without JSON wrapping. Offers greater flexibility for external runtimes like:<br>• Code sandboxes (Python, C++, Java, …)<br>• SQL databases<br>• Shell environments<br>• Config generators | Use when structured JSON isn’t needed and raw text is more natural for the target tool. |\n",
    "| 3. | **Context-Free Grammar (CFG)** | A set of production rules defining valid strings in a language. Each rule rewrites a non-terminal into terminals and/or other non-terminals, independent of surrounding context. Useful for constraining output to match the syntax of programming languages or custom formats in OpenAI tools. | Use as a contract to ensure the model emits only valid strings accepted by the grammar. |\n",
    "| 4. | **Minimal Reasoning** | Runs GPT-5 with few or no reasoning tokens to minimize latency and speed time-to-first-token. Ideal for deterministic, lightweight tasks (extraction, formatting, short rewrites, simple classification) where explanations aren’t needed. If not specified, effort defaults to medium. | Set reasoning effort: \"minimal\". Avoid for multi-step planning or tool-heavy workflows. |\n",

This provides greater flexibility for interacting with external runtimes and allows the model to generate code or text in the exact format your tool expects. It’s ideal when structured JSON is unnecessary and natural text output improves usability."

    "A context‑free grammar is a collection of production rules that define which strings belong to a language. Each rule rewrites a non‑terminal symbol into a sequence of terminals (literal tokens) and/or other non‑terminals, independent of surrounding context—hence context‑free. CFGs can capture the syntax of most programming languages and, in OpenAI custom tools, serve as contracts that force the model to emit only strings that the grammar accepts.\n",
