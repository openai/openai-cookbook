Here are cleaner, more user-friendly options. Pick based on where it appears:

- Heading: What kind of website would you like to build?
- Friendly: What type of site do you want to build today?
- Conversational: Tell us about the website you want to build.
- Direct/CTA: Choose your website type.
- Goal-focused: What’s your website for?

If it’s a form:
- Label: Website type
- Helper text: e.g., portfolio, blog, online store. You can change this later.
- Button: Continue or Start building

Want me to tailor it to your brand voice and placement (headline, field label, modal, etc.)?
