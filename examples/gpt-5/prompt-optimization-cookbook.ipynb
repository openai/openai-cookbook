    "This baseline prompt is something that you could expect from asking ChatGPT to write you a prompt, or talking to a friend who is knowledgeable about coding but not particularly invested in your specific use case. Our baseline prompt is intentionally shorter and friendlier, but it hides mixed signals that can push the model into inconsistent solution families.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we say to prefer the standard library, then immediately allow external packages “if they make things simpler.” That soft permission can nudge the model toward non‑portable dependencies or heavier imports that change performance and even execution success across environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we encourage single‑pass streaming to keep memory low, but we also say it’s fine to reread or cache “if that makes the solution clearer.” That ambiguity opens the door to multi‑pass designs or in‑memory caches that defeat the original streaming constraint and can alter runtime and memory profiles.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also ask for exact results while permitting approximate methods “when they don’t change the outcome in practice.” This is a judgment call the model can’t reliably verify. It may introduce sketches or heuristics that subtly shift counts near the Top‑K boundary, producing results that look right but fail strict evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "We advise avoiding global state, yet suggest exposing a convenient global like `top_k`. That mixes interface contracts: is the function supposed to return data, or should callers read globals? Models may implement both, causing side effects that complicate evaluation and reproducibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "Documentation guidance is similarly split: “keep comments minimal” but “add brief explanations.” Depending on how the model interprets this, you can get under‑explained code or prose interleaved with logic, which sometimes leaks outside the required output format.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we ask for “natural, human‑friendly” sorting while also mentioning strict tie rules. These aren’t always the same. The model might pick convenience ordering (e.g., `Counter.most_common`) and drift from the evaluator’s canonical `(-count, token)` sort, especially on ties—leading to subtle correctness misses.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this matters**: the softened constraints make the prompt feel easy to satisfy, but they create forks in the road. The model may pick different branches across runs—stdlib vs external deps, one‑pass vs reread/cache, exact vs approximate—yielding variability in correctness, latency, and memory.\n",
    "\n",
