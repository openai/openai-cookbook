Manual ASCII scanning with ord ranges and micro-optimizations (local variable bindings, buf list and clear) slightly reduce readability compared to a regex approach but are still understandable.\\n- Correctness: Tokenization matches the specified ASCII [a-z0-9]+ rule and lowercasing. Sorting uses a robust key (-count, token) and nsmallest, yielding the correct order.
