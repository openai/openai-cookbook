Uppercase A-Z are lowered by adding 32, digits are kept, and all other characters act as separators. This produces exactly the [a-z0-9]+ tokens required and lowercases them. However, the instructions explicitly say to use a regex for tokenization; this code does not use regex. Functionally correct but deviates from the specified method.\\n- Sorting: Uses heapq.nsmallest with key lambda (-count, token) to obtain items sorted by count descending then token ascending. This matches the required sort order and avoids relying on Counter.most_common tie behavior.\\n- Output format: top_k is set to a list of (token, count) tuples of length min(k, unique tokens). This is satisfied: m = min(k, len(counts)) and the returned list contains (token, count) pairs from counts.items().\\n- Edge cases: If k <= 0, _top_k_tokens returns []. Also handles empty text (counts empty -> []). Both align with the requirements.\\n- Inputs: Does not reassign globals text or k. It copies them into _text and _k with fallbacks if not defined and safely coerces _k to int. This respects the constraint not to reassign provided globals and allows the script to run as-is.\\n- No I/O: No input(), file I/O, or network access.

Counting and Top-K selection are correct.
