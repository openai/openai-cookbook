  "raw": "{\n  \"reasoning\": {\n    \"task_adherence\": \"- Tokenization: Uses a compiled regex r\\\"[a-z0-9]+\\\" with flags re.ASCII and re.IGNORECASE, and explicitly lowercases each token via .lower(). This satisfies the requirement to lowercase and to treat non-[a-z0-9] ASCII as separators using a regex.\\n- Inputs/Globals: The code reads globals text and k without reassigning them. It guards with a try/except to detect their presence. When provided, it sets top_k = top_k_tokens(text, k) as required. It does not use input(), file I/O, or networking.\\n- Requirement 1 (Sorting key): Sorting is implemented with key=lambda kv: (-kv[1], kv[0]) on (token, count) pairs. For k >= u or for the full-sort path, it uses sorted(..., key=key), which orders by count desc then token asc. For the selection path, it uses heapq.nsmallest(k, cnt.items(), key=key), which returns the k smallest by (-count, token) and in sorted order, equivalent to the specified ordering. It does not rely on Counter.most_common.\\n- Requirement 2 (Set top_k list and length): top_k_tokens returns a list of (token, count) tuples. Branches ensure the length is min(k, number of unique tokens):\\n  - If k >= u: returns all u items sorted.\\n  - Else: returns first k items either via sorted(... )[:k] or nsmallest(k, ...), both giving exactly k items.\\n- Requirement 3 (Edge case k <= 0): top_k_tokens returns [] when k <= 0. If there are zero unique tokens (u == 0), it also returns [].\\n- Requirement 4 (Script behavior): With provided globals, it computes and assigns top_k accordingly. No forbidden I/O is used. Optional printing is only performed in a demo block when globals are absent and __name__ == \\\"__main__\\\"; it prints only top_k on the last line, complying with the optional print rule.\\n- Output contract: At end of execution with provided globals, top_k is defined exactly as described. In demo mode, top_k is still defined and printed. No reliance on Counter.most_common tie behavior.\\n- Minor note: If executed without globals and not as __main__ (e.g., imported), top_k would not be defined; however, the task specifies that globals are provided for the execution context, so this does not violate the stated contract.\",\n    \"code_quality\": \"- Correctness: Logic matches the specification precisely; ordering key is correct; selection via heapq.nsmallest yields exact Top-K in the required order.\\n- Efficiency: Uses Counter for O(N) counting. Selects between full sort O(U log U) when k is a large fraction of U and heap-based selection O(U log k) otherwise; includes a clear complexity comment.\\n- Readability/Maintainability: Code is clear and well-structured. Helper function _tokens and compiled regex improve clarity and performance. Type hints are used appropriately. Inline comment explains the selection heuristic.\\n- Best practices: Avoids Counter.most_common ties. Does not mutate globals. Demo guarded by if __name__ == \\\"__main__\\\". Uses key functions instead of relying on unspecified tie ordering.\\n- Minor nit: re.IGNORECASE is redundant since tokens are lowercased afterward, but it does not harm correctness.\",\n  \"final_judgement\": {\n    \"adherence_score\": 5,\n    \"code_quality_score\": 5,\n    \"comments\": \"Meets all task requirements exactly, including tokenization, ordering, edge cases, and output contract. Code is clean, efficient, and well-structured. Only minor nit is redundant IGNORECASE given explicit lowercasing.\"\n  }\n}",
