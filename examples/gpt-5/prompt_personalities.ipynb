    "# Shaping your agent’s personality\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to ChatGPT’s built-in personality [presets](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/11899719-customizing-your-chatgpt-personality), you can steer your Agent’s behavior by explicitly defining its personality in your prompt instructions. These instructions—sometimes called the “system prompt” or “developer prompt”—guide the agent’s tone, detail level, and style of responses. In this notebook, we’ll refer to them simply as “instructions,” following the term used in the [OpenAI API documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/text-generation/introduction) for consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "Defining personality at the system instructions level helps control verbosity, structure, and decision-making style across all interactions."

    "## What is agent personality? \n",
    "\n",
    "A personality defines the style and tone the model uses when responding. It shapes how answers feel - for example, polished and professional, concise and utilitarian, or direct and corrective.\n",
    "\n",
    "Changing the personality influences how responses are communicated. Personalities also do not override task‑specific output formats. If you ask for an email, code snippet, JSON, or résumé, the model should follow your instructions and the task context rather than the selected personality.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Below are example personalities for API and agent use, with sample instruction prompts you can adapt directly in your application.** The examples show that personality should not be treated as aesthetic polish, but as an operational lever that improves consistency, reduces drift, and aligns model behavior with user expectations and business constraints."

    "Agent personality is a critical lever for shaping how your system behaves in production. By defining personality instructions explicitly at the system or developer-prompt level, you can reliably steer tone, verbosity, structure, and decision-making style without interfering with task-specific instructions or output formats.\n",

    "This cookbook demonstrated how different personality profiles—such as Professional, Efficient, Fact-based, and Exploratory—map cleanly to real-world use cases, from enterprise workflows and developer tooling to research assistants and internal enablement. \n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, the most effective approach is to start with a minimal, well-scoped personality aligned to the target workload, validate it through evals, and evolve it deliberately as requirements change. Avoid overloading personalities with task logic or domain rules—keep them focused on how the agent responds, not what it must do.\n",
    "\n",
    "Used thoughtfully, agent personalities enable you to build systems that are not only more useful, but more predictable, scalable, and trustworthy in real production environments.\n"
