    "Changing the personality influences how responses are communicated. Personalities also do not override task‑specific output formats. If you ask for an email, code snippet, JSON, or résumé, the model should follow your instructions and the task context rather than the selected personality.\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Agent personality is a first-class control surface for shaping how your system behaves in production. By defining personality explicitly at the system or developer-prompt level, you can reliably steer tone, verbosity, structure, and decision-making style without interfering with task-specific instructions or output formats.\n",
    "\n",
    "This cookbook demonstrated how different personality profiles—such as Professional, Efficient, Source-based, and Nerdy—map cleanly to real-world use cases, from enterprise workflows and developer tooling to research assistants and internal enablement. The examples show that personality should not be treated as aesthetic polish, but as an operational lever that improves consistency, reduces drift, and aligns model behavior with user expectations and business constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, the most effective approach is to start with a minimal, well-scoped personality aligned to the target workload, validate it through evals, and evolve it deliberately as requirements change. Avoid overloading personalities with task logic or domain rules—keep them focused on how the agent responds, not what it must do.\n",
    "\n",
    "Used thoughtfully, agent personalities enable you to build systems that are not only more useful, but more predictable, scalable, and trustworthy in real production environments.\n"
