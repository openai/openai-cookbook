    "# Building a Supply-Chain Copilot with OpenAI Agent SDK and Databricks MCP Servers\n",
    "\n",
    "## Solution Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In supply-chain operations, an agent can resolve questions that directly affect service levels and revenue: Do we have the inventory and capacity to satisfy current demand? Where will manufacturing delays occur, and how will those delays propagate downstream? Which workflow adjustments will minimise disruption? \n",
    "\n",
    "![Databricks MCP UI](../../images/databricks_mcp_ui.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This cookbook outlines the process for building a supply-chain copilot with the OpenAI Agent SDK and Databricks Managed MCP. MCP enables the agent to query structured and unstructured enterprise data, such as inventory, sales, supplier feeds, local events, and more, for real-time visibility, early detection of material shortages, and proactive recommendations. An orchestration layer underpins the system, unifying:\n",
    "- Queries against structured inventory, demand, and supplier data\n",
    "- Time series forecasting for every wholesaler\n",
    "- Graph based raw material requirements and transport optimizations\n",
    "- Vector-indexed e-mail archives that enable semantic search across unstructured communications \n",
    "- Revenue risk calculation\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this guide you will deploy a template that queries distributed data sources, predictive models, highlights emerging bottlenecks, and recommends proactive actions. It can address questions such as:\n",
    "- What products are dependent on L6HUK material?\n",
    "- How much revenue is at risk if we can’t produce the forecasted amount of product autoclave_1?\n",
    "- Which products have delays right now?\n",
    "- Are there any delays with syringe_1? \n",
    "- What raw materials are required for syringe_1?\n",
    "- Are there any shortages with one of the following raw materials: O4GRQ, Q5U3A, OAIFB or 58RJD?\n",
    "- What are the delays associated with wholesaler 9?\n",
    "\n",
    "Stakeholders can submit a natural-language prompt and receive answers instantly.\n",
    "This guide walks you through each step to implement this solution in your own environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "The architecture presented in this cookbook layers an OpenAI Agent on top of your existing analytics workloads in Databricks. You can expose Databricks components as callable Unity Catalog functions. The agent is implemented with the [OpenAI Agent SDK](https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python/) and connects to [Databricks Managed MCP servers](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/generative-ai/agent-framework/mcp). \n",
    "\n",
    "The result is a single, near-real-time conversational interface that delivers fine-grained forecasts, dynamic inventory recommendations, and data-driven decisions across the supply chain. The architecture yields an agent layer that harnesses your existing enterprise data (structured and unstructured), classical ML models, and graph-analytics capabilities.\n",

    "Alternatively, you can accelerate your setup by using a tailored version of the Databricks’ Supply Chain Optimization Solution Accelerator. To do so, you can clone this GitHub [repository](https://github.com/lara-openai/databricks-supply-chain) into your Databricks workspace and follow the instructions in the README [file](https://github.com/lara-openai/databricks-supply-chain/blob/main/README.md). Running the solution will stand up every asset the Agent will later reach via MCP, from raw enterprise tables and unstructured e-mails to classical ML models and graph workloads. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you prefer to use your own datasets and models, make sure to wrap relevant components as Unity Catalog functions and define a Vector Search index as shown in the accelerator. You can also expose Genie Spaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "The sample data mirrors a realistic pharma network: three plants manufacture 30 products, ship them to five distribution centers, and each distribution center serves 30-60 wholesalers. The repo ships time-series demand for every product-wholesaler pair, a distribution center-to-wholesaler mapping, a plant-to-distribution center cost matrix, plant output caps, and an e-mail archive flagging shipment delays. \n",

    "Answering supply-chain operations questions requires modelling how upstream bottlenecks cascade through production, logistics, and fulfilment so that stakeholders can shorten lead times, avoid excess stock, and control costs. The notebooks turn these raw feeds into governed, callable artefacts:\n",
    "- Demand forecasting & aggregation ([notebook 2](https://github.com/lara-openai/databricks-supply-chain/blob/main/02_Fine_Grained_Demand_Forecasting.py)): Generates one-week-ahead SKU demand for every wholesaler and distribution center with a Holt-Winters seasonal model (or any preferred time-series approach). It leverages Spark’s parallelisation for large-scale forecasting tasks by using Pandas UDFs (taking your single node data science code and distributing it across multiple nodes). Forecasts are then rolled up to DC-level totals for each product. The output is a table  product_demand_forecasted with aggregate forecasts at the distribution center level.\n",
    "- Raw-material planning ([notebook 3](https://github.com/lara-openai/databricks-supply-chain/blob/main/03_Derive_Raw_Material_Demand.py)): Constructs a product-to-material using graph processing, propagating demand up the bill-of-materials hierarchy to calculate component requirements at scale. We transform the bill‑of‑materials into a graph so product forecasts can be translated into precise raw‑material requirements, yielding two tables: raw_material_demand and raw_material_supply.\n",
    "- Transportation optimisation ([notebook 4](https://github.com/lara-openai/databricks-supply-chain/blob/main/04_Optimize_Transportation.py)): Minimises plant to distribution center transportation cost under capacity and demand constraints, leveraging Pandas UDFs, outputting recommendations in shipment_recommendations.\n",
    "- Semantic e-mail search ([notebook 6](https://github.com/lara-openai/databricks-supply-chain/blob/main/06_Vector_Search.py)): Embeds supply-chain manager e-mails in a vector index using OpenAI embedding models, enabling semantic queries that surface delay and risk signals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each insight is wrapped as a Unity Catalog (UC) function in [notebook 5](https://github.com/lara-openai/databricks-supply-chain/blob/main/05_Data_Analysis_%26_Functions.py) and [notebook 7](https://github.com/lara-openai/databricks-supply-chain/blob/main/07_More_Functions.py), e.g. product_from_raw, raw_from_product, revenue_risk, lookup_product_demand, query_unstructured_emails. Because UC governs tables, models, and vector indexes alike, the Agent can decide at runtime whether to forecast, trace a BOM dependency, gauge revenue impact, fetch history, or search e-mails, always within the caller’s data-access rights.\n",
    "\n",
    "The result is an end-to-end pipeline that forecasts demand, identifies raw‑material gaps, optimizes logistics, surfaces hidden risks, and lets analysts ask ad‑hoc questions and surface delay warnings.\n",
    "\n",
    "After all notebooks have been executed (by running notebook 1), the Databricks environment is ready, you can proceed to build the Agent and connect it to Databricks."

Both tools make authenticated, POST requests through httpx, returning raw JSON from the Databricks REST API.

At startup it configures CORS so a local front-end can talk to it, then defines `build_mcp_servers()`, which authenticates to the caller’s Databricks workspace, constructs two HTTP “server tools” (one for vector search, one for Unity-Catalog functions), and pre-connects them for low-latency use. Each incoming POST to /chat contains a single user message. The handler spins up a fresh Agent whose mcp_servers list is populated by those streaming tools and whose model is forced to call a tool for every turn. "
