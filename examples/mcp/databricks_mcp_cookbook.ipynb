    "# Building a Supply-Chain Copilot with OpenAI Agent SDK and Databricks MCP Servers\n",
    "\n",
    "## Solution Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In supply-chain operations, an agent can resolve questions that directly affect service levels and revenue: Do we have the inventory and capacity to satisfy current demand? Where will manufacturing delays occur, and how will those delays propagate downstream? Which workflow adjustments will minimise disruption? \n",
    "\n",
    "![Databricks MCP UI](../../images/databricks_mcp_ui.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This cookbook outlines the process for building a supply-chain copilot with the OpenAI Agent SDK and Databricks Managed MCP. MCP enables the agent to tap structured and unstructured enterprise data, such as inventory, sales, supplier feeds, local events, and more, for real-time visibility, early detection of material shortages, and proactive recommendations. An orchestration layer underpins the system, unifying:\n",
    "- Queries against structured inventory, demand, and supplier data\n",
    "- Classical forecasting models for fine-grained demand and lead-time predictions \n",
    "- Graph based route optimizations \n",
    "- Vector-indexed e-mail archives that enable semantic search across unstructured communications for delay signals\n",
    "- Generative AI workflows that surface insights and mitigation options in plain language\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this guide you will deploy a production-ready template that queries distributed data sources, predictive models, highlights emerging bottlenecks, and recommends proactive actions. It can address questions such as:\n",
    "- What products are dependent on L6HUK material?\n",
    "- How much revenue is at risk if we can’t produce the forecasted amount of product autoclave_1?\n",
    "- Which products have delays right now?\n",
    "- Are there any delays with syringe_1? \n",
    "- What raw materials are required for syringe_1?\n",
    "- Are there any shortages with one of the following raw materials: O4GRQ, Q5U3A, OAIFB or 58RJD?\n",
    "- What are the delays associated with wholesaler 9?\n",
    "\n",
    "Stakeholders can submit a single natural-language prompt and receive answers instantly.\n",
    "This guide walks you through each step to implement this solution in your own environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "Answering supply-chain operations questions requires modelling how upstream bottlenecks cascade through production, logistics, and fulfilment so that stakeholders can shorten lead times, avoid excess stock, and control costs. \n",
    "\n",
    "The architecture presented in this cookbook layers an OpenAI Agent on top of your existing analytics workloads in Databricks. You can expose Databricks components as callable Unity Catalog functions. The agent, implemented with the OpenAI Agent SDK and connecting to [Databricks Managed MCP servers](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/generative-ai/agent-framework/mcp), orchestrates those tools alongside generative-AI workflows. It queries Databricks and returns consolidated insights in plain language. \n",
    "\n",
    "The result is a single, near-real-time conversational interface that delivers fine-grained forecasts, dynamic inventory recommendations, and data-driven decisions across the supply chain. The architecture yields an agent layer that harnesses your existing enterprise data (structured and unstructured), classical ML models, and graph-analytics capabilities.\n",

It leverages Spark’s parallelisation for large-scale forecasting tasks by using Pandas UDFs (taking your single node data science code and distributing it across multiple nodes). Forecasts are then rolled up to DC-level totals for each product. The output is a table  product_demand_forecasted with aggregate forecasts at the distribution center level.\n",
    "- Raw-material planning ([notebook 3](https://github.com/lararachidi/agent-supply-chain/blob/main/03_Derive_Raw_Material_Demand.py)): Constructs a product-to-material using graph processing, propagating demand up the bill-of-materials hierarchy to calculate component requirements at scale. We transform the bill‑of‑materials into a graph so product forecasts can be translated into precise raw‑material requirements, yielding two tables: raw_material_demand and raw_material_supply.\n",
    "- Transportation optimisation ([notebook 4](https://github.com/lararachidi/agent-supply-chain/blob/main/04_Optimize_Transportation.py)): Minimises plant to distribution center transportation cost under capacity and demand constraints, leveraging Pandas UDFs, outputting recommendations in shipment_recommendations.\n",
    "- Semantic e-mail search ([notebook 6](https://github.com/lararachidi/agent-supply-chain/blob/main/06_Vector_Search.py)): Embeds supply-chain manager e-mails in a vector index using OpenAI embedding models, enabling semantic queries that surface delay and risk signals.\n",

It starts by reading environment variables that point to the target catalog, schema, and Unity Catalog (UC) function path, then exposes two tools: vector_search, which queries a Databricks Vector Search index, and uc_function, which executes Unity Catalog functions via MCP. Both tools make authenticated, POST requests through httpx, returning raw JSON from the Databricks REST API. Both helpers obtain the workspace host and Personal Access Token through the _databricks_ctx() utility (backed by DatabricksOAuthClientProvider) and issue authenticated POST requests with httpx, returning raw JSON responses. \n",

    "Inside run_agent(), the script instantiates an Agent called “Assistant” that is hard-scoped to supply-chain topics. Every response must invoke one of the two registered tools, and guardrails force the agent to refuse anything outside logistics, inventory, procurement or forecasting. Each user prompt is processed inside an SDK trace context. A simple REPL drives the interaction: user input is wrapped in an OpenTelemetry-style trace, dispatched through Runner.run, and the final answer (or guardrail apology) is printed. The program is kicked off through an asyncio.run call in main(), making the whole flow fully asynchronous and non-blocking. \n"
