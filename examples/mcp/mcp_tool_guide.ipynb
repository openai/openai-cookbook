    "Building agentic application often requires connecting to external services. Traditionally, this is done through function calling where every action makes a round-trip from the model to your backend, then to an external service, waits for a response, and finally returns the result to the model. This process introduces multiple network hops and significant latency, making it cumbersome to scale and manage.\n",
    "\n",
    "The hosted Model Context Protocol (MCP) tool in the Responses API makes this easier. Instead of manually wiring each function call to specific services, you can configure your model once to point to an MCP server (or several!). That server acts as a centralized tool host, exposing standard commands like “search product catalog” or “add item to cart.” This allows for simpler orchestration and centralized management of tools. With MCP, the model interacts directly with the MCP server, reducing latency and eliminating backend coordination."

    "## How the tool works\n",
    "\n",
    "At a high level, here is how the MCP tool works: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Declare the server: When you add an MCP block to the `tools` array, the Responses API runtime first detects which transport the server speaks, either the newer “streamable HTTP” or the older HTTP-over-SSE variant, and uses that protocol for traffic.\n",
    "2. Import the tool list: The runtime calls the server’s `tools/list`, passing any headers you provide (API key, OAuth token, etc.). It then writes the result to an `mcp_list_tools` item in the model’s context. While this item is present, the list won’t be fetched again. You can limit what the model sees using `allowed_tools`. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    OpenAI discards header values and all but the schema, domain, and subdomains of the MCP `server_url` after each request. Authorization keys and the server URL must be included with every API call. These values won't appear in response objects. Schemas use “strict” mode when possible, otherwise they're loaded as-is.\n",
    "    \n",
    "3. Call and approve tools: Once the model knows the available actions, it can invoke one. Each invocation produces an `mcp_tool_call` item and by default the stream pauses for your explicit approval, but you can disable this once you trust the server.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    After approval, the runtime executes the call, streams back the result, and the model decides whether to chain another tool or return a final answer."

    "## Best practices when building with MCP\n",
    "\n",
    "MCP is still in its early stages, so here are best practices that can improve model performance and behavior as you build. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Filter tools to avoid ballooning payloads\n",
    "\n",
    "Remote servers often expose numerous tools without considering how models will interpret and use them. By default, this can result in dozens of endpoints being included, each accompanied by verbose definitions like names, descriptions, and JSON schemas that add hundreds of tokens to the model’s context and increase latency. Compounding this, many servers return entire data objects, such as full Stripe invoice records, even when only a few fields are relevant to the model’s task. To optimize for performance in production, use the `allowed_tools` parameter in the Responses API to limit which tools are included from the server’s `mcp_list_tools`. This reduces token overhead, improves response time, and narrows the model’s decision space. You may also want to exclude certain tools altogether, such as those capable of write actions or those that have financial or security implications."

    "### Reduce latency and tokens via caching and reserve reasoning models for high complexity tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "The first time the model connects to a server, a new item of the type `mcp_list_tools` is created for each MCP server you add. As long as this item is present in the model's context, we will not call `tools/list` on the server again. This is akin to caching at the user-conversation level. If `mcp_list_tools` is not present, we import the list of tools from the MCP server again. Passing`previous_response_id` in subsequent API requests is one way of ensuring that the `mcp_list_tools` item is present in the model's context on follow-up turns. Alternatively you can also pass in the items manually to new response. The other lever that will affect latency and the number of output tokens is whether you use a reasoning model, as reasoning models will produce far more output tokens, as well as reasoning tokens. Take for example the following two sample curls that compare the number of tokens produced with and without reasoning models:"

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The hosted MCP tool in the Responses API turns external-service access from a bespoke plumbing task into a first-class capability of the API. By connecting to a remote server, letting the runtime cache its tool list, and trimming that list with `allowed_tools`, you eliminate the extra network hop, cut token overhead, and give the model a concise, discoverable action set. When combined with built-in tools such as `code_interpreter`, `web_search_preview`, or `image_gen`, MCP unlocks rich, multi-service workflows whether you’re analyzing sales data, triaging production errors, or automating checkout flows."
