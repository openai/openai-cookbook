      "In the spring of 2017, a young OpenAI engineer named Alec Radford began conducting a series of experiments that would shape the future of artificial intelligence. Armed with a fresh innovation from Google called a transformer neural network, Radford set out to explore its possibilities. Unlike existing systems, transformers could process and analyze vast volumes of text, making connections in ways previously unimaginable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Radford's approach was novel. He fed the transformer a database of 7,000 unpublished English-language books, a treasure trove of human narrative‚Äîfrom romance to adventure to speculative fiction. Rather than direct the network to translate text, as Google initially did, Radford posed a simpler challenge: predict the next word in a sentence. The results were astounding. Word by word, the machine began to generate text, not from rigid rules or a grammar guide, but seemingly through an innate understanding birthed from the stories it consumed. This experimentation paved the way for what we now know as ChatGPT, which made headlines in 2022 with its ability to create text that felt eerily human.\n",
      "\n",
      "By 2017, OpenAI, co-founded by the entrepreneurial Sam Altman and tech magnate Elon Musk, was still striving for a breakthrough. With Altman as the public face, OpenAI was grappling with ambitious projects‚Äîlike teaching virtual robots to backflip‚Äîwhile simultaneously grappling with existential questions about artificial general intelligence, or AGI. The team faced a crossroads: pursue these intriguing but ultimately limited projects, or leverage Radford's discovery at a larger scale.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ultimately, Radford's success sparked a decisive shift within OpenAI. Under Altman's leadership, they chose to prioritize large-scale language models over others, pooling resources into amassing extensive training data beyond Radford‚Äôs initial cache. Partnerships, particularly with Microsoft, which offered computing power at unparalleled levels, became pivotal, catapulting OpenAI from potential to performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "OpenAI‚Äôs focus on language models, while requiring immense computing power and resources, began to bear fruit. GPT-2 launched in 2019, marking a significant milestone in the AI world, succeeded by the consumer-friendly ChatGPT in 2022. As user numbers soared, so did the sense of technological momentum and anticipation.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, OpenAI's journey also ignited debates. Karen Hao, in her exhaustive exploration \"Empire of AI\", traces the ripple effects of OpenAI's model on the industry, arguing that Altman's choices, backed by his unique networking skills and vision, led the AI sector down a path of relentless scale and competition. The OpenAI model took root as an industry standard, sparking a race to scale AI models globally.\n",
      "\n",
      "The organization's structure evolved too, balancing between its nonprofit aspirations and a for-profit subsidiary to attract necessary funding and talent. Such complexities were not without challenges. Internal tensions occasionally fractured the company, as seen in late 2023 with the brief dismissal of Altman in what became known internally as \"the Blip\". Amid these challenges, Altman's calm during such turbulence marked his transformation‚Äîfrom a curious innovator to a shrewd, business-oriented leader.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sam Altman's story, thus, is interwoven with the story of AI itself‚Äînot just about the technology, but about the decisions, risks, and personalities that shape its evolution. Altman remains a key figure, navigating AI's dizzying possibilities with both optimism and caution, as technology continues to reshape our world.\n"
