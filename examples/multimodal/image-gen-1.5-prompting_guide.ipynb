    "`gpt-image-1.5` is our latest image generation model, designed for production-quality visuals and highly controllable creative workflows. It delivers major improvements in realism, accuracy, and editability, making it well-suited for both professional design tasks and iterative content creation. It delivers major improvements in realism, accuracy, and editability compared to the previous generation, and supports both high-quality rendering and low-latency use cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Capabilities include: \n",
    "\n",
    "- **High-fidelity photorealism** with natural lighting, accurate materials, and rich color rendering\n",
    "- **Flexible quality–latency tradeoffs**, allowing faster generation at lower settings while still exceeding the visual quality of prior-generation image models\n",
    "- **Robust facial and identity preservation** for edits, character consistency, and multi-step workflows\n",
    "- **Reliable text rendering** with crisp lettering, consistent layout, and strong contrast inside images\n",
    "- **Complex structured visuals**, including infographics, diagrams, and multi-panel compositions\n",
    "- **Precise style control and style transfer** with minimal prompting, supporting everything from branded design systems to fine-art styles\n",
    "- **Strong real-world knowledge and reasoning**, enabling accurate depictions of objects, environments, and scenarios\n",

    "## 2. Prompting Fundamentals\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Structure + goal:** Write prompts in a consistent order (background/scene → subject → key details → constraints) and include the intended use (ad, UI mock, infographic) to set the “mode” and level of polish. For complex requests, use short labeled segments or line breaks instead of one long paragraph.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Specificity + quality cues:** Be concrete about materials, shapes, textures, and the visual medium (photo, watercolor, 3D render), and add targeted “quality levers” only when needed (e.g., *film grain*, *textured brushstrokes*, *macro detail*). For photorealism, camera/composition terms (lens, aperture feel, lighting) often steer realism more reliably than generic “8K/ultra-detailed.”\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Latency vs fidelity**: For latency-sensitive or high-volume use cases, start with setting quality=\"low\" and evaluate whether it meets your visual requirements. In many cases, it provides sufficient fidelity with significantly faster generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Composition:** Specify framing and viewpoint (close-up, wide, top-down), perspective/angle (eye-level, low-angle), and lighting/mood (soft diffuse, golden hour, high-contrast) to control the shot. If layout matters, call out placement (e.g., “logo top-right,” “subject centered with negative space on left”).\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Constraints (what to change vs preserve):** State exclusions and invariants explicitly (e.g., “no watermark,” “no extra text,” “no logos/trademarks,” “preserve identity/geometry/layout/brand elements”). For edits, use “change only X” + “keep everything else the same,” and repeat the preserve list on each iteration to reduce drift.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Text in images:** Put literal text in **quotes** or **ALL CAPS** and specify typography details (font style, size, color, placement) as constraints. For tricky words (brand names, uncommon spellings), spell them out letter-by-letter to improve character accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Multi-image inputs:** Reference each input by **index and description** (“Image 1: product photo… Image 2: style reference…”) and describe how they interact (“apply Image 2’s style to Image 1”). When compositing, be explicit about which elements move where (“put the bird from Image 1 on the elephant in Image 2”).\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Iterate instead of overloading:** Start with a clean base prompt, then refine with small, single-change follow-ups (“make lighting warmer,” “remove the extra tree,” “restore the original background”). Use references like “same style as before” or “the subject” to leverage context, but re-specify critical details if they start to drift."

    "In this notebook, we demonstrate how to use gpt-image-1.5 to build high-quality, controllable image generation and editing workflows that hold up in real production settings. The cookbook emphasizes prompt structure, explicit constraints, and small iterative changes as the primary tools for controlling realism, layout, text accuracy, and identity preservation. We cover both generation and editing patterns—ranging from infographics, photorealism, UI mockups, and logos to translation, style transfer, virtual try-on, compositing, and lighting changes. Throughout the examples, the cookbook reinforces the importance of clearly separating what should change from what must remain invariant, and of restating those invariants on every iteration to prevent drift. We also highlight how quality and input-fidelity settings enable deliberate tradeoffs between latency and visual precision depending on the use case. Together, these examples form a practical, repeatable playbook for deploying gpt-image-1.5 in production image workflows."
