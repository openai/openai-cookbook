    "When developing customer service solutions, one of the initial steps involves transforming knowledge base articles into a set of routines that an LLM can comprehend and follow. A routine, in this context, refers to a set of step-by-step instructions designed specifically for the LLM to execute efficiently. Each routine is carefully structured so that a step corresponds to a clear action. Actions can include responding to a user, triggering a function call, or retrieving additional relevant knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most internal knowledge base articles are complex and structured for human interpretation. They often include intricate diagrams, multi-step processes, and decision trees that pose challenges for LLM-based solutions to reason through in a meaningful way. By breaking down these documents into routines, each instruction can be simplified and formatted in a way that guides the LLM through a series of small, manageable tasks. This granular approach reduces ambiguity, allowing the LLM to process the information methodically and reducing the risk of hallucination or deviation from the expected path.\n",
    "\n",
    "Converting these knowledge base articles into routines can be time-consuming and challenging, especially for companies attempting to build an automated pipeline. Each routine must account for various user scenarios, where actions need to be clearly defined. For instance, when a function call is necessary, the routine must specify the exact information to retrieve or the action to execute—whether it’s triggering an API, retrieving external data, or pulling in additional context. While automating this process with traditional GPT-class models can significantly reduce the manual effort involved, it often introduces new challenges. Some challenges include designing robust instructions that are specific enough for the LLM to follow consistently, capturing unique edge cases that may arise during customer interactions, providing high-quality few-shot examples to guide the model’s behavior, and in some cases, fine-tuning the model to achieve more reliable or specialized outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "o1 has demonstrated the capability to efficiently deconstruct these articles and convert them into sets of routines zero-shot, meaning that the LLM can understand and follow the instructions without extensive examples or prior training on similar tasks. This minimizes the prompting effort required, as the routine structure itself provides the necessary guidance for the LLM to complete each step. By breaking down tasks into specific actions and integrating function calls where needed, o1’s approach ensures that even complex workflows can be handled seamlessly by the LLM, leading to more effective and scalable customer service solutions."

    "In this example, we will use a set of publicly available Help Center articles from the OpenAI website and convert them into internal routines that an LLM can execute. Besides transforming the policies into routines, we will also have the model generate functions that allow the LLM to perform actions on behalf of the user. This is necessary to allow the LLM to execute the same actions that human agents have, and access additional information that may not be immediately available just from the policy documentation.\n",

       "      <td>How do I submit a VAT exemption request?<br>Updated over a week ago<br>If you are eligible for a tax exemption and would like to apply it to your account, please follow these steps: <br><br>Depending on the state and if required: <br>1. Obtain a current tax exemption certificate from your state or local government and/or your fully completed non-profit sales tax exemption forms. The certificate/forms should include: <br>    Your name and address<br>    Tax exemption number<br>    Signatures and dates, etc. <br>2. Send us a copy of your certificate using the chat widget in the bottom-right corner. Please include your organization id, invoice number or email address associated with the account, so we can easily find you. Instructions on how to find these items are below.<br><br>3. Once we receive your certificate/form, we will review it and apply the tax exemption to your account. You will receive a confirmation email once the exemption has been applied. <br><br>Please note that the tax exemption will only apply to future purchases. We cannot apply VAT exemptions retroactively.<br><br> <br><br>Where to find your account data<br>In order to submit a Value Added Tax ('VAT') exemption request you will need the following from your organization Billing preferences:<br>    1. Company name<br>    2. Billing email<br>    3. Primary business address<br>    4. Business tax ID</td>\n",
       "      <td>1. Greet the customer and acknowledge their request.<br>   1a. Say: \"Certainly, I'd be happy to assist you with submitting a VAT exemption request.\"<br><br>2. Request necessary information from the customer.<br>   2a. Politely ask for the following:<br>       - \"Could you please provide your **company name**?\"<br>       - \"May I have the **billing email** associated with your account?\"<br>       - \"Could you provide your **primary business address**?\"<br>       - \"Please provide your **business tax ID**.\"<br>   2b. If the customer needs assistance finding this information, provide guidance.<br>       - Say: \"You can find this information in your organization's billing preferences.\"<br><br>3. Request a copy of their current tax exemption certificate.<br>   3a. Say: \"Could you please send us a copy of your current **tax exemption certificate**? It should include your name and address, tax exemption number, signatures, and dates.\"<br><br>4. Instruct the customer on how to send the certificate.<br>   4a. Say: \"You can send us a copy of your certificate using the **chat widget in the bottom-right corner**.\"<br>   4b. Say: \"Please include your **organization ID**, **invoice number**, or the **email address associated with your account** so we can easily find you.\"<br><br>5. Once the customer has provided the required information and certificate:<br>   5a. `call the process_vat_exemption_request function` with parameters: company_name, billing_email, business_address, business_tax_id, tax_exemption_certificate, account_identifier.<br>   5b. **Define `process_vat_exemption_request function`**:<br>       - **Purpose**: To review and apply the VAT exemption to the customer's account based on the provided information and certificate.<br>       - **Parameters**:<br>         - company_name<br>         - billing_email<br>         - business_address<br>         - business_tax_id<br>         - tax_exemption_certificate<br>         - account_identifier (organization ID/invoice number/email address)<br><br>6. Inform the customer:<br>   6a. Say: \"Thank you. Once we have reviewed your certificate, we will apply the VAT exemption to your account.\"<br>   6b. Say: \"You will receive a confirmation email once the exemption has been applied.\"<br>   6c. Say: \"Please note that the tax exemption will only apply to future purchases. We cannot apply VAT exemptions retroactively.\"<br>   6d. If the customer requests to apply the VAT exemption to past purchases:<br>       - Say: \"I apologize, but we're unable to apply VAT exemptions to past purchases. The tax exemption will only apply to future purchases once it's applied to your account.\"<br><br>7. Ask if there is anything more you can assist with.<br>   7a. Say: \"Is there anything else I can assist you with today?\"<br><br>8. `call the case_resolution function`</td>\n",

    "Upon reviewing the generated routines, we can derive several insights:\n",
    "- Sample Responses: The model effectively generates sample responses that the LLM can utilize when executing the policy (e.g., “Instruct the user: ‘Confirm and purchase your initial amount of credits.’”).\n",
    "- Discrete Steps: The model excels at decomposing the problem into discrete actions that the LLM needs to execute. Each instruction is clearly defined and easy to interpret.\n",
    "- Function Definitions: The routines’ outputs include clearly defined functions to retrieve external information or trigger actions (e.g., `review_and_apply_tax_exemption`, `get_billing_plan`, `update_payment_method`).\n",
    "    - This is crucial for any successful routine because LLMs often need to interact with external systems. Leveraging function calls is an effective way to interact with those systems and execute actions.\n",
    "- IFTTT Logic: The model effectively employs IFTTT (If This, Then That) logic, which is ideal for an LLM (e.g., “If the customer requests assistance, proceed to step 3f.”).\n",
    "    - This type of translation becomes extremely valuable when the original knowledge base articles contain complex workflows and diagrams. Such complexity may not be easily understood by humans, and even less so by an LLM. IFTTT logic is easily comprehensible and works well for customer service solution"

    "These routines can now be integrated into agentic systems to address specific customer issues. When a customer requests assistance with tasks such as setting up prepaid billing, we can employ a classifier to determine the appropriate routine to retrieve and provide that to the LLM to interact directly with the customer. Beyond providing instructions to the user on *how* to set up billing, the system can also perform the action on their behalf.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before deploying these routines into production, we should develop comprehensive evaluations to test and validate the quality of the model’s responses. This process may necessitate adjusting the routines to ensure compliance and effectiveness."
