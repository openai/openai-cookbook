    "## Build Your Own Code Interpreter - Dynamic Tool Generation and Execution With o3-mini\n",
    "\n",
    "At the core of providing a LLM Agent capability to interact with the outside world or other Agents is “tool (or function) calling,” where a LLM can invoke a function (a block of code) with arguments. Typically, these functions are predefined by the developer, along with their expected inputs and outputs. However, in this Cookbook, we explore a more flexible paradigm - to **dynamically generate tools** using LLM models (in this case **o3-mini**), with ability to execute the tool using a code interpreter.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dynamically Generated Tool Calling with Code Interpreter\n",
    "A Dynamically Generated Tool is a function or code block created by the LLM itself at runtime based on the user’s prompt. This means you don’t have to predefine every possible scenario in your codebase—enabling far more open-ended, creative, and adaptive problem-solving.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dynamically Generated Tool Calling goes a step further by granting the LLM the ability to generate tools and execute code blocks on the fly. This dynamic approach is particularly useful for tasks that involve:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data analysis and visualization\n",
    "- Data manipulation and transformation\n",
    "- Machine learning workflow generation and execution\n",
    "- Process automation and scripting\n",
    "- And much more, as new possibilities emerge through experimentation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using o3-mini for Dynamic Tool generation\n",
    "\n",
    "Released on 31-Jan-25, o3-mini model has exceptional STEM capabilities—with particular strength in science, math, and coding—all while maintaining the low cost and reduced latency of smaller models. In this Cookbook, we will demonstrate o3-mini's capabilities to generate python code to interpret data and draw insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reasoning models are particularly good at generating dynamic tools to analyze data since they can reason on their own, without the need of an explicit chain-of-thought prompt. In fact, providing explicit chain of thought instructions may interfere with model's internal reasoning and lead to suboptimal outcomes. You can learn more about o3-mini [here.](https://openai.com/index/openai-o3-mini/)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why build your own code interpreter\n",
    "\n",
    "Many API providers—such as OpenAI’s Assistants API—offer built-in code interpreter functionality. These built-in code interpreters can be immensely powerful, but there are situations where developers may need to create their own custom code interpreter. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Language or library support**: The built-in interpreter may not support the specific programming language (e.g., C++, Java, etc.) or libraries required for your task.\n",
    "2. **Task compatibility**: Your use case may not be compatible with the provider’s built-in solution.\n",
    "3. **Model constraints**: You might require a language model that isn’t supported by the provider’s interpreter.\n",
    "4. **Cost considerations**: The cost structure for code execution or model usage may not fit your budget or constraints.\n",
    "5. **File size**: The file size of input data is too large or not supported by the provider's interpreter.\n",
    "6. **Integrating with internal systems**: The provider's interpreter may not be able to integrate with your internal systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What You’ll Learn\n",
    "By following this Cookbook, you will learn how to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Set up an isolated Python code execution environment using Docker\n",
    "- Configure your own code interpreter tool for LLM agents\n",
    "- Establish a clear separation of “Agentic” concerns for security and safety\n",
    "- Using **o3-mini** model to dynamically generate code for data analysis\n",
    "- Orchestrate agents to efficiently accomplish a given task\n",
    "- Design an agentic application that can dynamically generate and execute code\n",
    "\n",
    "You’ll learn how to build a custom code interpreter tool from the ground up, leverage the power of LLMs to generate sophisticated code, and safely execute that code in an isolated environment—all in pursuit of making your AI-powered applications more flexible, powerful, and cost-effective."

    "### Example Scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll use the sample data provided at [Key Factors Traffic Accidents](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/willianoliveiragibin/key-factors-traffic-accidents) to answer a set of questions. These questions do not require to be pre-defined, we will give LLM the ability to generate code to answer such question. \n",
    "\n",
    "Sample questions could be: \n",
    "- What factors contribute the most to accident frequency? (Feature importance analysis)\n",
    "- Which areas are at the highest risk of accidents? (Classification/Clustering)\n",
    "- How does traffic fine amount influence the number of accidents? (Regression/Causal inference)\n",
    "- Can we determine the optimal fine amounts to reduce accident rates? (Optimization models)\n",
    "- Do higher fines correlate with lower average speeds or reduced accidents? (Correlation/Regression)\n",
    "- and so on ...\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the traditional **Predefined Tool Calling** approach, developer would need to pre-define the function for each of these questions. This limits the LLM's ability to answer any other questions not defined in the pre-defined set of functions. We overcome this limitation by using the **Dynamic Tool Calling** approach where the LLM generates code and uses a Code Interpretter tool to execute the code. "

    "#### Step 1: Set up an isolated code execution container environment\n",
    "\n",
    "We need a secure environment where our LLM generated function calls can be executed. We want to avoid directly running the LLM generated code on the host machine so will create a Docker container environment with restricted resource access (e.g., no network access). By default, Docker containers cannot access the host machine’s file system, which helps ensure that any code generated by the LLM remains contained. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### ⚠️ A WORD OF CAUTION: Implement Strong Gaurdrails for the LLM generated code\n",
    "LLMs could generate harmful code with unintended consequences. As a best practice, isolate the code execution environment with only required access to resources as needed by the task. Avoid running the LLM generated code on your host machine or laptop. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 2: Define and Test the Agents\n",
    "\n",
    "\"**What is an Agent?**\" In the context of this Cookbook, an Agent is:\n",
    "1. Set of instructions for the LLM to follow, i.e. the developer prompt\n",
    "2. A LLM model, and ability to call the model via the API \n",
    "3. Tool call access to a function, and ability to execute the function \n",
    "\n",
    "We will define two agents:\n",
    "1. FileAccessAgent: This agent will read the file and provide the context to the PythonCodeExecAgent.\n",
    "2. PythonCodeExecAgent: This agent will generate the Python code to answer the user's question and execute the code in the Docker container.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 3: Set up Agentic Orchestration to run the application \n",
    "There are various ways to orchestrate the Agents based on the application requirements. In this example, we will use a simple orchestration where the user provides a task and the agents are called in sequence to accomplish the task.  \n",

      "The analysis (both the correlation study and the random forest feature importance) indicates that the traffic fine amount is the single most influential factor related to accident frequency. Here’s a summary of the key results:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The Pearson correlation between accidents and traffic fine amount is about –0.75 (a strong negative relationship), which implies that as fine amount increases, accident frequency tends to decrease.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. In the random forest model, the traffic fine amount had the highest feature importance (approximately 58% importance), followed by traffic density (about 17%) and rain intensity (around 10%). These three predictors drive most of the model’s ability to predict accident frequency.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Other factors such as average speed, pavement quality, traffic lights, vehicle count, urban area, and time of day contribute less significantly according to both the correlation and feature importance analysis.\n",
      "\n",

    "\n",
    "**Approach for Managing Agents and Tools**: We also defined a set of core classes to manage the agents and tools. This approach ensures that the agents and tools will have a consistent interface and can be reused across different applications. A repository of agents and tools such as the [registry](https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook/tree/main/examples/object_oriented_agentic_approach/resources/registry) folder can be created to manage the agents and tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "To recap, the three steps to build an Agentic Application with Dynamic Tool Calling are:\n",
    "1. Set up an isolated code execution container environment\n",
    "2. Define and Test the Agents\n",
    "3. Set up Agentic Orchestration to run the application \n",
    "\n",
    "We discussed the importance of isolating the code execution environment to ensure security and avoid running untrusted code on the host machine. With the use case of a CSV file, we demonstrated how to dynamically generate a tool (a Python script) to analyze the data and answer the user's question. We also showed how to execute the code in a Docker container and return the output to the user."
