  "reasoning": "The receipt is for gasoline, which is considered a travel-related expense, so it does not meet the NOT_TRAVEL_RELATED criterion. The total amount is $49.61, which is below the $50 limit, so the AMOUNT_OVER_LIMIT criterion is not violated. There are no discrepancies in the math for computing the total, confirming that MATH_ERROR is false. There is no 'X' present in the handwritten notes, meaning HANDWRITTEN_X is also false. Since none of the criteria are violated, the receipt does not need auditing.",
