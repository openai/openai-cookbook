  "reasoning": "The receipt is for fuel, which is classified as a travel-related expense, hence it does not satisfy the NOT_TRAVEL_RELATED criterion. The total amount of $60.91 exceeds the $50 limit, thus satisfying the AMOUNT_OVER_LIMIT criterion. There are no discrepancies in the arithmetic calculations for the total, so MATH_ERROR is false. However, there is a handwritten 'X' noted in the handwritten notes, which satisfies the HANDWRITTEN_X criterion.   1. NOT_TRAVEL_RELATED: This is a fuel purchase (travel-related), so not_travel_related=false. 2. AMOUNT_OVER_LIMIT: Total of $60.91 exceeds $50, so amount_over_limit=true. 3. MATH_ERROR: 4.199×14.5076≈60.9174, which rounds up to $60.92 or truncates to $60.91, the listed total (either would be acceptable), so math_error=false. 4. HANDWRITTEN_X: The note 'X' is written on the the receipt, so handwritten_x=true. At least one criterion is violated, so needs_audit=true.",
