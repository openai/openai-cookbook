The total amount of the receipt is $60.94, which exceeds the $50 limit, making the 'Amount Over Limit' criterion TRUE. There are no discrepancies in the math as the total matches the sum of the item prices, and there is no 'X' in the handwritten notes. Since one of the criteria (Amount Over Limit) is violated, the receipt needs to be audited.",
