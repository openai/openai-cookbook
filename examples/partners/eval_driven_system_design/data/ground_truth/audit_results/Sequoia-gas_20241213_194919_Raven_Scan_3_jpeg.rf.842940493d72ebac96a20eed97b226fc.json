AMOUNT_OVER_LIMIT: The total amount of $38.26 is below the $50 threshold, so this criterion is FALSE. 3. MATH_ERROR: The line item for fuel ($38.26) matches the computed total, indicating no math errors, so this criterion is FALSE. 4. HANDWRITTEN_X: There is no 'X' present in the handwritten notes on the receipt, making this criterion FALSE. Since all criteria are not violated (all FALSE), the receipt does not need auditing.",
