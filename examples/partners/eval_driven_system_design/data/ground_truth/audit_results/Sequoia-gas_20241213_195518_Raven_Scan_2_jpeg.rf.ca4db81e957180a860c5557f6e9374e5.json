Amount Over Limit: The total amount of $47.06 does not exceed $50, so this criterion is FALSE.\n3. Math Error: The total amount ($47.06) matches the calculated total from the line item (3.859 * 12.195 = 47.06), so there is no math error, making this criterion FALSE.\n4. Handwritten X: There are no 'X's noted in the handwritten notes, hence this criterion is FALSE.\nSince none of the criteria are violated, the receipt does not need auditing.",
