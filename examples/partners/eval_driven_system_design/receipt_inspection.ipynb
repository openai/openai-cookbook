    "# Eval-Driven System Design: From Prototype to Production\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "### Purpose of This Cookbook\n",
    "\n",
    "This cookbook provides a **practical**, end-to-end guide on how to effectively use \n",
    "evals as the core process in creating a production-grade autonomous system to \n",
    "replace a labor-intensive human workflow. It's a direct product of collaborative \n",
    "experience dealing with projects where users may not have started with pristine \n",
    "labeled data or a perfect understanding of the problem - two issues that most tutorials gloss \n",
    "over but are in practice almost always serious challenges.\n",
    "\n",
    "Making evals the core process prevents poke-and-hope guesswork and impressionistic\n",
    "judgments of accuracy, instead demanding engineering rigor. This means we can make\n",
    "principled decisions about cost trade-offs and investment. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Target Audience\n",
    "\n",
    "This guide is designed for ML/AI engineers and Solution Architects who are\n",
    "looking for practical guidance beyond introductory tutorials. This notebook is fully\n",
    "executable and organized to be as modular as possible to support using code\n",
    "samples directly in your own applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Guiding Narrative: From Tiny Seed to Production System\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll follow a realistic storyline: replacing a manual receipt-analysis service for validating expenses.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Start Small:** Begin with a very small set of labeled data (retail receipts). Many businesses don't have good ground truth data sets. \n",
    "* **Build Incrementally:** Develop a minimal viable system and establish initial evals. \n",
    "* **Business Alignment:** Evaluate eval performance in the context of business KPIs and\n",
    "  dollar impact, and target efforts to avoid working on low-impact improvements.\n",
    "* **Eval-Driven Iteration:** Iteratively improve by using eval scores to power model\n",
    "  improvements, then by using better models on more data to expand evals and identify more\n",
    "  areas for improvement.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to Use This Cookbook\n",
    "\n",
    "This cookbook is structured as an eval-centric guide through the lifecycle of building\n",
    "an LLM application.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If you're primarily interested in the ideas presented, read through the text and skim over\n",
    "   the code.\n",
    "2. If you're here because of something else you're working on, you can go ahead and jump to that\n",
    "   section and dig into the code there, copy it, and adapt it to your needs.\n",
    "3. If you want to really understand how this all works, download this notebook and run\n",
    "   the cells as you read through it; edit the code to make your own changes, test your\n",
    "   hypotheses, and make sure you actually understand how it all works together.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note: If your OpenAI organization has a Zero Data Retention (ZDR) policy, Evals will still be available, but will retain data to maintain application state."

    "## Use Case: Receipt Parsing\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to condense this guide we'll be using a small hypothetical problem that's still complex\n",
    "enough to merit detailed and multi-faceted evals. In particular, we'll be focused on how\n",
    "to solve a problem given a limited amount of data to work with, so we're working with a\n",
    "dataset that's quite small.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "For this guide, we assume that we are starting with a workflow for reviewing and filing \n",
    "receipts. While in general, this is a problem that already has a lot of established \n",
    "solutions, it's analogous to other problems that don't have nearly so much prior work; \n",
    "further, even when good enterprise solutions exist there is often still a \n",
    "\"last mile\" problem that still requires human time.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our case, we'll assume we have a pipeline where:\n",
    "\n",
    "* People upload photos of receipts\n",
    "* An accounting team reviews each receipt to categorize and approve or audit the expense\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on interviews with the accounting team, they make their decisions based on\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Merchant\n",
    "2. Geographic location\n",
    "3. Expense amount\n",
    "4. Items or services purchased\n",
    "5. Handwritten notes or annotations\n",
    "\n",
    "Our system will be expected to handle most receipts without any human intervention, but\n",
    "escalate low-confidence decisions for human QA. We'll be focused on reducing the total\n",
    "cost of the accounting process, which is dependent on\n",
    "\n",
    "1. How much the previous / current system cost to run per-receipt\n",
    "2. How many receipts the new system sends to QA\n",
    "3. How much the system costs to run per-receipt, plus any fixed costs\n",
    "4. What the business impact is of mistakes, either receipts kicked out for review or mistakes missed\n",
    "5. The cost of engineering to develop and integrate the system\n",
    "\n",

    "## Project Lifecycle\n",
    "\n",
    "Not every project will proceed in the same way, but projects generally have some \n",
    "important components in common.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Project Lifecycle](../../../images/partner_project_lifecycle.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The solid arrows show the primary progressions or steps, while the dotted line \n",
    "represents the ongoing nature of problem understanding - uncovering more about\n",
    "the customer domain will influence every step of the process. We wil examine \n",
    "several of these iterative cycles of refinement in detail below. \n",
    "Not every project will proceed in the same way, but projects generally have some common\n",
    "important components.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Understand the Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually, the decision to start an engineering process is made by leadership who\n",
    "understand the business impact but don't need to know the process details. In our\n",
    "example, we're building a system designed to replace a non-AI workflow. In a sense this\n",
    "is ideal: we have a set of domain experts, *the people currently doing the task* who we\n",
    "can interview to understand the task details and who we can lean upon to help develop\n",
    "appropriate evals.\n",
    "\n",
    "This step doesn't end before we start building our system; invariably, our initial\n",
    "assessments are an incomplete understanding of the problem space and we will continue to\n",
    "refine our understanding as we get closer to a solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Assemble Examples (Gather Data)\n",
    "\n",
    "It's very rare for a real-world project to begin with all the data necessary to achieve a satisfactory solution, let alone establish confidence.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our case, we'll assume we have a decent sample of system *inputs*, in the form of but receipt images, but start without any fully annotated data. We find this is a not-unusual situation when automating an existing process. We'll walk through the process of incrementally expanding our test and training sets in collaboration with domain experts as we go along and make our evals progressively more comprehensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Build an End-to-End V0 System\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to get the skeleton of a system built as quickly as possible. We don't need a\n",
    "system that performs well - we just need something that accepts the right inputs and\n",
    "provides outputs of the correct type. Usually this is almost as simple as describing the\n",
    "task in a prompt, adding the inputs, and using a single model (usually with structured\n",
    "outputs) to make an initial best-effort attempt.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Label Data and Build Initial Evals\n",
    "\n",
    "We've found that in the absence of an established ground truth, it's not uncommon to \n",
    "use an early version of a system to generate 'draft' truth data which can be annotated \n",
    "or corrected by domain experts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have an end-to-end system constructed, we can start processing the inputs we\n",
    "have to generate plausible outputs. We'll send these to our domain experts to grade \n",
    "and correct. We will use these corrections and conversations about how the experts \n",
    "are making their decisions to design further evals and to embed expertise in the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Map Evals to Business Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we jump into correcting every error, we need to make sure that we're investing\n",
    "time effectively. The most critical task at this stage is to review our evals and\n",
    "gain an understanding of how they connect to our key objectives.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Step back and assess the potential costs and benefits of the system\n",
    "- Identify which eval measurements speak directly to those costs and benefits\n",
    "- For example, what does \"failure\" on a particular eval cost? Are we measuring\n",
    "  something worthwhile?\n",
    "- Create a (non-LLM) model that uses eval metrics to provide a dollar value\n",
    "- Balance performance (accuracy, or speed) with cost to develop and run\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Progressively Improve System and Evals\n",
    "\n",
    "Having identified which efforts are most worth making, we can begin iterating on \n",
    "improvements to the system. The evals act as an objective guide so we know when we've\n",
    "made the system good enough, and ensure we avoid or identify regression. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. Integrate QA Process and Ongoing Improvements\n",
    "\n",
    "Evals aren't just for development. Instrumenting all or a portion of a production\n",
    "service will surface more useful test and training samples over time, identifying\n",
    "incorrect assumptions or finding areas with insufficient coverage. This is also the only\n",
    "way you can ensure that your models continue performing well long after your initial\n",
    "development process is complete."

    "This cookbook focuses on the philosophy and practicalities of evals, not the full range of model improvement techniques. For boosting or maintaining model performance (especially when moving to smaller, faster, or cheaper models), consider these steps in order—start from the top, and only proceed down if needed. For example, always optimize your prompt before resorting to fine-tuning; fine-tuning on a weak prompt can lock in bad performance even if you improve the prompt later.\n",

    "1. **Model selection:** try smarter models, or increase their reasoning budget.\n",
    "2. **Prompt tuning:** clarify instructions and provide very explicit rules.\n",
    "3. **Examples and context:** add few- or many-shot examples, or more context for the\n",
    "   problem. RAG fits in here, and may be used to dynamically select similar examples.\n",
    "4. **Tools use:** provide tools to solve specific problems, including access to external\n",
    "   APIs, the ability to query databases, or otherwise enable the model to have its own\n",
    "   questions answered.\n",
    "5. **Accessory models:** add models to perform limited sub-tasks, to supervise and provide\n",
    "   guardrails, or use a mixture of experts and aggregate solutions from multiple\n",
    "   sub-models.\n",
    "6. **Fine-tuning:** use labeled training data for supervised fine tuning, eval\n",
    "   graders for reinforcement fine tuning, or different outputs for direct preference\n",
    "   optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "The above options are all tools to maximize performance. Once you're trying to optimize\n",
