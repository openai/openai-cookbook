    "# Self-Evolving Agents: A Cookbook for Autonomous Agent Retraining\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Agentic systems often reach a plateau after proof-of-concept because they depend on humans to diagnose edge cases and correct failures. This cookbook introduces a repeatable retraining loop that captures those issues, learns from the feedback, and promotes improvements back into production-like workflows. We ground the approach in a regulated healthcare documentation task, but the patterns generalize to any domain that demands accuracy, auditability, and rapid iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What You Will Learn\n",
    "- Diagnose why an autonomous agent falls short of production readiness and instrument it with measurable feedback signals.\n",
    "- Compare three prompt-optimization strategies—from quick manual iteration to fully automated loops—and understand when to reach for each.\n",
    "- Assemble a self-healing workflow that combines human review, LLM-as-judge evals, and iterative prompt refinement.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Who This Notebook Is For\n",
    "- ML/AI engineers and solution architects who need to move beyond toy demos.\n",
    "- Product and delivery teams looking for executable artifacts they can adapt into internal tooling or production pipelines.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to Work Through This Notebook\n",
    "1. Start with Section 1 to understand the healthcare use case, baseline agent, and system architecture.\n",
    "2. Use Section 2 to practice prompt optimization within the OpenAI Evals interface and collect structured feedback.\n",
    "3. Run Section 3 to automate the optimization loop with graders, evals, and retraining logic.\n",
    "4. Reference the appendix for reusable prompts, configurations, and evaluation templates as you tailor the workflow to your environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook is modular—feel free to run sections independently or sequentially as you adapt the retraining loop to your own agents."

    "## 1. Use Case Overview: Self-Evolving Agents in Healthcare\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "For this cookbook, we focus on a **real-world use case**: drafting regulatory documents for pharmaceutical companies. These organizations must prepare and submit extensive documentation to regulatory authorities (e.g., the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) to obtain approval for new drugs. The accuracy and speed of these submissions are critical, as they directly impact how quickly life-saving treatments can reach patients.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Regulatory document drafting is a highly complex, iterative, and precision-driven process that requires deep scientific, medical, and compliance expertise. Despite the availability of advanced authoring tools, it remains labor-intensive and prone to human error. **Agentic systems offer substantial leverage** by assisting with research synthesis, content generation, and document structuring, yet human experts are still needed to ensure factual accuracy and regulatory compliance.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The key challenge is to design a feedback loop that enables these agentic systems to learn iteratively and refine model behavior over time. Such a system can gradually shift human effort from detailed correction to high-level oversight, improving efficiency while maintaining the rigorous standards required for regulatory submissions.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Self-evolving Agent\n",
    "\n",
    "The diagram below illustrates the iterative process for continuously improving an AI agent through feedback, meta prompting, and evaluation. The loop combines human judgment or automated feedback using an LLM-as-a-judge to iteratively enhance performance.  \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../../../images/baseline_agent.png\" alt=\"Self-evolving loop\" style=\"max-width:50%\"/>\n",
    "<br><em>Figure 1 - Diagram showing the self-evolving loop for automated agent improvement.</em>\n",
    "\n",
    "The process consists of the following steps:  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Baseline Agent**  \n",
    "   The process begins with a baseline agent. In this notebook, we use a deliberately simple example (an agent that summarizes sections of a document) to illustrate the iterative improvement loop. In real-world or enterprise settings, the baseline agent could be much more complex. The summaries it produces serve as the initial benchmark for subsequent evaluation and refinement.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Human Feedback (or LLM-as-judge)**  \n",
    "   The baseline agent’s outputs are then evaluated either by human reviewers (e.g., for production environments) and/or by an automated **LLM-as-judge** system. This step gathers both quantitative and qualitative feedback that indicates how well the agent meets its goals — for instance, if we are testing the length of the summary, the feedback might be “the summary is too long” or a numerical score (generally between `0` and `1`) generated by eval when assessing if the summary is under 500 words.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Evals and Aggregated Score**  \n",
    "   Based on the collected feedback, new prompts are generated and tested through evaluations (**Evals**). These tests measure performance against predefined criteria, and the outcomes are combined into an aggregated score that reflects the overall performance. The loop continues until the score exceeds a target threshold (e.g., `0.8`) or the maximum number of retries is reached (e.g., `max_retry = 10`). If the retry limit is hit, engineers are alerted that manual improvements are required.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Updated Baseline Agent**  \n",
    "   Once an improved version achieves the target performance, it replaces the original baseline agent. This updated agent becomes the foundation for the next iteration, supporting a continuous cycle of learning, feedback, and optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset used for evaluation comprises ~70 sections extracted from the _Sample CMC Section for Hyperpolarized Pyruvate (13C) Injection_, publicly available [here](https://dctd.cancer.gov/drug-discovery-development/reagents-materials/imaging-ind-resources/documentation/13c-pyruvate-cmc.pdf). This dataset provides realistic, domain-specific content suitable for testing both scientific summarization and regulatory compliance behavior. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Baseline Agent Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "To keep this cookbook self-contained and easily reproducible, we simplified the regulatory drafting use case while retaining its essential complexity. In production, a typical regulatory authoring agent comprises multiple specialized sub-agents responsible for tasks such as drafting, data analysis, compliance checking, citation generation, and fact verification.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this guide, we narrow the scope of the regulatory authoring agent to focus on the self-healing aspect of the system. Our regulatory authoring agent consists of two sub-agents:\n",
    "- **A summarizer** creating scientific and concise summaries.\n",
    "- **A compliance checker**: evaluating each summary against key regulatory requirements (e.g., FDA 21 CFR Part 11).  \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../../../images/simplified_reg_agent.png\" alt=\"Baseline Agent\" style=\"max-width:50%\"/>\n",
    "<br><em>Figure 2 - The baseline agent as created in the AgentBuilder UI.</em>\n",
    "\n",
    "For the remainder of this cookbook, we implemented a simplified version of the Summarizer agent (see the section **Agent Setup** below). Alternatively, you can reuse the code for the agent created with AgentBuilder. If you’d like to reproduce the agent directly from the AgentBuilder UI, here are the key prompts and parameters used:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Summarizer agent:** This agent used the file search tool, where the [CMC PDF](\"data/c13_pyruvate_sample_CMC_from_UCSF.pdf\") was uploaded to the vector store.\n",
    "> _Prompt:_ \"Summarize section {{workflow.input_as_text}} from {{state.cmc_pdf}} uploaded to the vector store.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Compliance Checker agent:**\n",
    "> _Prompt:_ \"Verify that the summary below is compliant with FDA 21 CFR Part 11: {{input.output_text}}. If the summary is compliant, return _Compliant_. Otherwise, return _This section needs to be manually summarized_.\"  \n",
    "\n",
    "Both agents were configured with the default parameters - using GPT-5, low reasoning effort, and text as the output format.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Evaluation Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "To evaluate the baseline agent, there are two main approaches:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Collecting Human Feedback.** This approach involves gathering feedback from human users through the OpenAI Evals platform (or a custom UI built for a specific application). It is best suited for production settings or when piloting a tool where subject matter experts (SMEs) interact with the tool in real-world scenarios. This method helps uncover edge cases that may not have been identified during development. On the Evals platform, users can provide thumbs-up or thumbs-down ratings and share qualitative feedback about the summaries.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Using an LLM-as-a-Judge.** This option is typically used during the development phase, enabling fast feedback loops without requiring SME's time. An **LLM-as-a-judge** uses an LLM to automatically evaluate and score the agent’s outputs based on predefined criteria. It can also be used for monitoring model drift (e.g., in production) or validating changes between model and model versions (e.g., switching between `gpt-5` and `gpt-5-mini`).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This cookbook demonstrates both approaches:\n",
    "- **Section 2** shows the platform UI approach for manual prompt optimization\n",
    "- **Section 3** implements the fully automated API approach using LLM-as-a-judge\n",
    "\n",
    "_Note: The Evals platform does not yet provide an API to retrieve user feedback programmatically._\n"

    "## 2. Using the OpenAI Evals Platform\n",
    "\n",
    "The OpenAI Evals platform provides an intuitive interface for prompt optimization and evaluation. This section demonstrates the complete workflow from dataset upload through iterative prompt improvement, showing how you can leverage the platform's visual interface to optimize your prompts before implementing automated solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Upload Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin using the OpenAI Evaluation platform, you'll first need to upload your dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Click the **+ Create** button\n",
    "2. Define the dataset name\n",
    "3. Upload a CSV file and select the columns to keep\n",
    "4. Upload\n",
    "\n",
    "Your dataset should contain the documents or document sections that need to be summarized. Each row represents one input that will be processed by your system.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Explore Your Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Once uploaded, you can explore your dataset. Click the dataset name to explore the uploaded data. This allows you to verify that your data is properly formatted and contains the expected content before proceeding with prompt configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Configure Initial Prompt\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where you define your initial system prompt and configure how data flows through your model.  \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../../../images/prompt_input.png\" alt=\"Platform Prompt Configuration\" style=\"max-width:50%\">\n",
    "<br><em>Figure 3 - The platform's \"New prompt\" interface showing model configuration, variables, and system message settings.</em>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Configuration Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **System Prompt**: Add the system message that defines the model's task and behavior (this prompt will be optimized)\n",
    "2. **User Prompt Template**: Add the prompt message template for user messages, using variables such as `{{<column_name>}}` that get replaced with actual data from your dataset\n",
    "3. **Model Selection**: Choose the model for generation (e.g., gpt-4.1, gpt-5)\n",
    "4. **Temperature**: Configure creativity vs. determinism\n",
    "\n",
    "You can start with a very simple prompt to demonstrate the power of the optimization process. For example, beginning with just \"summarize\" shows how the system can evolve from a minimal starting point.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4: Generate Outputs\n",
    "\n",
    "Once your prompt is configured, you're ready to generate outputs across your dataset. The prompt will run once per row and output will be generated on a new **output** column.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Click **\"Generate Output\"**\n",
    "2. The platform runs your prompt against all samples\n",
    "3. Results appear in a new **Output** column\n",
    "\n",
    "The platform will process each row in your dataset, replacing template variables with actual values and calling the model with your system prompt. This creates a baseline of outputs that you can evaluate.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 5: Review and Evaluate\n",
    "\n",
    "Evaluation is where you provide structured feedback to guide prompt improvement.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Review Outputs\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Add Evaluation Columns** if not automatically added - Click \"Columns\" → \"Annotations\" → \"Add\":\n",
    "   - **Rating** - Binary (good/bad) or numeric ratings\n",
    "   - **Feedback** - Text describing what needs improvement\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Provide Rating and Feedback** - Add your assessment for each output.   \n",
    "\n",
    "   Depending on the quality of the output, you may select a good or bad rating and explain your score based on how you would like the answer to be improved. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "      > (Rating) | Feedback\n",
    "      > - (Good) Good, but only the answer should be provided. The output should not include headers or any text other than the answer.\n",
    "      > - (Bad)  The information is good, but it should be presented as bullet points.\n",
    "      > - (Good) Good summary; it is clear.\n",
    "      > - (Bad)  Use bullet points when answering to improve readability. Summarize each sub-section individually.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Save Annotations** - Your feedback is saved with the evaluation run\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../../../images/feedback.png\" alt=\"Platform Evaluation Interface\" style=\"max-width:50%\">\n",
    "<br><em>Figure 4 - The evaluation interface showing generated outputs with rating and feedback columns for annotation.</em>\n",
    "\n",
    "This structured feedback becomes the foundation for automatic prompt optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 6: Optimize Prompt\n",
    "\n",
    "After collecting feedback, the platform can automatically generate an improved prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Click **\"Optimize\"**\n",
    "2. A new prompt version is generated in a new tab\n",
    "3. Click **\"View Prompt\"** to see the improved version\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../../../images/updated_prompt.png\" alt=\"Platform Optimized Prompt\" style=\"max-width:50%\">\n",
    "<br><em>Figure 5 - The improved prompt generated by the platform, showing detailed instructions and requirements.</em>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 7: Iterate and Compare\n",
    "\n",
    "With your improved prompt ready, start a new iteration to measure improvement.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Click **\"Generate Output\"**\n",
    "2. Review the new results and provide feedback on any remaining issues\n",
    "3. Click **\"Optimize\"** again if needed\n",
    "4. Repeat until satisfied\n",
    "\n",
    "The platform's tab structure allows you to compare performance across iterations. You can easily see how outputs evolved from your initial prompt to the optimized versions.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../../../images/updated_prompt_feedback.png\" alt=\"Platform Updated Prompt Feedback\" style=\"max-width:50%\">\n",
    "<br><em>Figure 6 - Feedback and evaluation results for the optimized prompt, showing improvements in output quality.</em>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### When to Stop Iterating\n",
    "\n",
    "Continue the optimization cycle until:\n",
    "- **Quality threshold reached**: >80% of outputs receive positive feedback\n",
    "- **Diminishing returns**: New iterations show minimal improvement\n",
    "- **Specific issues resolved**: All identified failure modes are addressed\n",
    "\n",
    "This platform-based approach provides an excellent foundation for understanding prompt optimization before moving to automated implementations. The visual interface makes it easy to see the impact of changes and understand the optimization process.\n"

    "|---|---|---:|---|---|\n",
    "| Chemical string name | `python` | 0.8 | If any exact chemical names in the section appear in the summary. | Forces preservation of critical domain entities so summaries don’t omit chemically meaningful terms. |\n",
    "| Summarization length | `python` | 0.85 | Inverse deviation from an expected 100-word length. | Keeps summaries concise and comparable, reducing verbosity that can mask poor content. |\n",
    "| Cosine similarity | `text_similarity` | 0.85 | Cosine similarity between section and summary texts. | Ensures the summary stays anchored to the source content rather than drifting semantically. |\n",

Consequently, this approach risked overfitting to immediate grader feedback instead of achieving broader generalization.\n",

    "### Examples of output prompts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Initial prompt:**  \n",
    "```pgsql \n",
    "You are a summarization assistant. Given a section of text, produce a summary.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **OpenAI Platform Optimizer:** \n",
    "```pgsql \n",
    "You are a summarization assistant.\n",
    "Task: Summarize the provided text concisely and accurately.\n",
    "Output requirements:\n",
    "- Output only the summary. Do not add titles, labels (e.g.,\n",
    "\"Summary:\"), prefaces, or commentary.\n",
    "- Preserve the document's structure. If multiple sections/subsections appear, summarize each one.\n",
    "- Use a numbered list for sections/subsections (use their numbers/titles when present).\n",
    "- Under each, use short dash bullets for key points.\n",
    "- If there is only a single short section, return a brief bullet list or 1-2 concise sentences.\n",
    "- Split any inline lists into separate bullets.\n",
    "- Use plain, simple language. Keep bullets tight (ideally one line each). Remove redundancy.\n",
    "- Include important quantitative details (values, units, conditions) and constraints. Do not invent information.\n",
    "- Keep formatting simple: plain text, \"1.\" numbering and \"-\" bullets only. No tables or special markup.\n",
    "- Retain exact technical terms/notation from the source (e.g., chemical names, isotopic labels).\n",
    "- If a section is explicitly marked \"Not applicable,\" include that status; otherwise do not add it.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Static metaprompt:** \n",

    "You are a technical summarization assistant for scientific and regulatory documentation. Your task is to generate a concise, comprehensive, and fully detailed summary of any scientific, technical, or regulatory text provided. Strictly adhere to the following instructions:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Complete and Exact Information Inclusion**  \n",
    "- Capture *every* explicit fact, technical value, specification, quantity, measurement, regulatory reference, entity, process, site, and contextual detail verbatim from the source text.\n",
    "- Do not omit or generalize any explicit information, no matter how minor.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Precise Terminology and Named Entity Retention**  \n",
    "- Reproduce all names of chemicals, drugs, mixtures, buffer components, devices, companies, institutions, regulatory standards, section numbers, and procedural labels *exactly as stated*.\n",
    "- Report all quantities, measurements, concentrations, ratios, masses, volumes, compositions, pH values, and units precisely as given.\n",
    "- Do not paraphrase, rename, substitute, or simplify any term or value.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. All Procedural Details and Justifications**  \n",
    "- Explicitly include all described procedures, technical processes (e.g., terminal sterilization, aseptic processing), operational constraints, process justifications, compliance requirements, and standards references.\n",
    "- Clearly state all reasons provided for choosing or omitting particular methods or processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Regulatory and Compliance References**  \n",
    "- Accurately cite all regulations, standards (e.g., USP <797>), compliance statements, section numbers, and cross-references as in the original.\n",
    "- Include all explicit mentions of compliance, applicability, and site location details.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Explicit Statements of Absence, Limitations, and Applicability**  \n",
    "- Clearly state any declarations of absence, inapplicability (“Not applicable”), or limitations exactly as written in the source.\n",
    "\n",
    "**6. Structural and Organizational Fidelity**  \n",
    "- Precisely reflect the original document’s section and subsection hierarchy, using clear section labels and indentation.\n",
    "- Present all enumerations, lists, and tabulated data in structured bullet-point or numbered format, organized in accordance with the source document’s arrangement.\n",
    "\n",
    "**7. No Paraphrasing, Summarizing, or Reinterpretation**  \n",
    "- Do *not* paraphrase, summarize contextually, reinterpret, or alter the meaning or sequence of any content.\n",
    "- Remove only literal repetitions or redundant phrasing; otherwise, preserve all explicit statements, technical details, and contextual notes.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Summary Output Objective:**  \n",
    "Produce a summary that delivers the full technical, factual, and regulatory content and structure of the original text, reformatted by eliminating only redundant language. The summary must enable audit, regulatory review, or peer reference without loss of any explicit information or terminology from the source.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "*Apply these instructions rigorously to every provided document section to ensure scientific and regulatory accuracy and completeness.*\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **GEPA optimizer**: \n",
    "```pgsql \n",
    "You are a domain-aware summarization assistant for technical pharmaceutical texts. Given a “section” of text, produce a concise, single-paragraph summary that preserves key technical facts and exact nomenclature.\n",
    "\n",
    "Length and format\n",
    "- Write 1–3 sentences totaling about 45–70 words (target ~60; never exceed 90).\n",
    "- Use one paragraph; no bullets, headings, tables, or heavy formatting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exact names and notation\n",
    "- Include every chemical name that appears in the section at least once, using the exact original spelling, capitalization, punctuation, isotopic labels, brackets, hyphens, salts, buffer names, and parenthetical qualifiers. Treat distinct case/format variants as distinct names (e.g., [1-13C]pyruvic acid and [1-13C]Pyruvic acid are separate and each must appear once).\n",
    "- Examples you must preserve verbatim when present: Hyperpolarized Pyruvate (13C) Injection; non-polarized Pyruvate Injection; Pyruvate (13C) Injection; hyperpolarized [1-13C]pyruvate; Mixture of [1-13C]pyruvic acid and 15 mM AH111501 sodium salt; TRIS/EDTA buffer solution; TRIS; NaOH; Na2EDTA; [1-13C]pyruvic acid; AH111501 sodium salt.\n",
    "- Also preserve exact study identifiers, batch codes, section numbers, regulatory citations, and instrument parameters as written (e.g., GE-101-001, GE-101-003, USP <797>, 3.2.P.5.2.5, FFF106/140-806, FFF106/142-806, 3T MRI, 5 degree RF pulse, TR=3s, 90 degree pulse, 64 averages, TR=10s, 10 μl Gd/ml solution).\n",
    "\n",
    "Content prioritization (if space is tight)\n",
    "1) What the section is about (topic/purpose).\n",
    "2) All named chemical entities and compositions (list all chemical names at least once; include concentrations/amounts if given).\n",
    "3) Critical process/handling facts (e.g., aseptic processing vs terminal sterilization; ISO classifications; filtration specs; compounding/filling steps; temperatures/times/volumes; storage/administration limits).\n",
    "4) Container/packaging specifics (e.g., cryovials, “sterile fluid path”).\n",
    "5) Microbiological/testing/regulatory details (e.g., sterility/pyrogenicity testing timing; USP <797>; state board compliance; site/manufacturer if stated).\n",
    "6) Overages/single-dose formulas and key quantities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Numerical fidelity\n",
    "- Preserve all critical numbers and units exactly (e.g., 1.44 g, 27.7 mg, 15 mM, 18 mL, 1.47 g, two 0.2 μm filters, ISO 7, ISO 5, 38 mL).\n",
    "- Include testing/analysis parameters when present (e.g., polarization/relaxation time (T1); number of spectra; pulse angles; TR values; MRI location relative to clean room).\n",
    "\n",
    "Style and compression\n",
    "- Be neutral and factual; do not infer unstated information.\n",
    "- Consolidate repeated statements; compress lists with commas/semicolons to save words.\n",
    "- Mention tables/figures only to convey key data; do not reproduce them.\n",
    "- If many chemicals are present, ensure each distinct name appears once; group them succinctly.\n",
    "- Avoid symbols or special formatting not in the source text.\n",
    "\n",
    "Common domain cues to include when present\n",
    "- Aseptic processing vs terminal sterilization and the rationale/timing (e.g., “tested for sterility and pyrogenicity subsequent to patient administration”).\n",
    "- Environmental/processing controls (ISO 7/ISO 5; LAF unit; filtration; filling/weight targets per cryovial).\n",
    "- Site/regulatory context (e.g., USP <797>; California State Board of Pharmacy; University of California, San Francisco Department of Clinical Pharmacy).\n",
    "- Study/kit equivalence statements (e.g., equivalence to GE-101-001/GE-101-003 formulations).\n",
    "- QC/measurement methods (e.g., capacitive threshold at Administration syringe nominal 38 mL).\n",
    "\n",
    "Self-check before finalizing\n",
    "- Does the paragraph contain every distinct chemical name exactly as written in the section (including case and notation variants)?\n",
    "- Is the summary 45–70 words (≤90), in a single paragraph?\n",
    "- Are the most critical process/regulatory/testing details and all key numbers preserved without unnecessary verbosity?`\n",
