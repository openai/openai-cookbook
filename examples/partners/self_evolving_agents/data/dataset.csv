3.2.P.2.2,30,Drug Product (Drug Product Kit Components),"3.2.P.2.2.1 Formulation Development (a) Mixture of [1-13C]pyruvic acid and 15 mM AH111501 sodium salt Mixture of [1-13C]pyruvic acid and 15 mM AH111501 sodium salt is dissolved in WFI and neutralized/buffered in TRIS/EDTA buffer solution to form a solution with a physiologically acceptable pH. The concentration of AH111501 sodium salt of 15 mM has been chosen for optimization of 13C nuclear polarization in Hyperpolarized Pyruvate (13C) Injection. For clinical trials GE-101-001 and GE-101-003, pyruvic acid was used instead of [1-13C]pyruvic acid. For these trials the Pyruvate Injection was not compounded hence; in order to mimic the maximum content of AH111501 in Hyperpolarized Pyruvate (13C) Injection, the kit component used during the clinical trials GE-101-001 and GE 101-003 was Mixture of pyruvic acid and 0.2 mM AH111501 sodium salt. In addition, some pre-clinical studies were performed using pyruvic acid instead of [1- 13C]pyruvic acid. See Section 3.2.P.2.2.1 Formulation development for Hyperpolarized Pyruvate (13C) Injection and section 8.1 Introduction for Item 8 Pharmacology and Toxicology Info) for further details. The amount of [1-13C]pyruvic acid and AH111501 sodium salt mixture per cryovial is 1.47 g, which upon dissolution in the total volume of WFI and TRIS/EDTA buffer solution, gives 250 mM [1- 13C]pyruvate in the final Hyperpolarized Pyruvate (13C) Injection. (b) TRIS/EDTA buffer solution The function of TRIS/EDTA buffer solution is to neutralize the [1-13C]pyruvic acid to [1- 13C]pyruvate and to assure a physiologically acceptable pH of the drug product Hyperpolarized Pyruvate (13C) Injection. TRIS/EDTA buffer solution has not been used during pre-clinical studies or during clinical trials GE-101-001 and GE-101-003. For these studies, the Mixture of [1-13C]pyruvic acid and AH111501 sodium salt was dissolved in a single, manual step in TRIS/EDTA dissolution medium.

7.3,41,Drug Product Part 2,"3.2.P DRUG PRODUCT (HYPERPOLARIZED PYRUVATE [13C] INJECTION) Hyperpolarized Pyruvate (13C) Injection (drug product) is a sterile solution for intravenous injection. Compounding the Hyperpolarized Pyruvate (13C) Injection requires the following drug product components: • Mixture of [1-13C]pyruvic acid and 15 mM AH111501 sodium salt • TRIS/EDTA buffer solution • Sterile Water for Injection (WFI) Hyperpolarized Pyruvate (13C) Injection is compounded at the clinical site utilizing an automated compounding device, known as SpinLab, according to USP <797> Pharmaceutical Compounding – Sterile Preparations, just prior to administration. For each patient does, SpinLab utilizes a single sterile fluid path that is composed of a cryovial which contains the mixture of [1-13C]pyruvic acid and 15 mM AH111501 sodium salt. The cryovial is lowered into the polarizer and polarized for up to 120 minutes at a temperature of approximately 0.8 K. After polarization, the mixture of [1- 13C]pyruvic acid and 15 mM AH111501 sodium salt is flushed out of the cryovial with heated and pressurized sterile WFI within the sterile fluid path then passed through a mechanical filter for removal of AH111501, then emptied into a receiver vessel containing sterile WFI and TRIS/EDTA buffer solution. A sample of solution from the receiver vessel is automatically extracted for testing by an automated quality control instrument (QC System). While the QC System processes the solution sample, the remaining solution in the receiver vessel is passed through a sterilizing filter (0.2 μm) and then enters the final drug product container for patient administration, a 65 mL MedRad syringe. Based on the results from the QC System, the final release authorization for administration to humans will be performed by a licensed pharmacist.

3.2.P.2.2,43,Drug Product (Hyperpolarized Pyruvate (13C) Injection),"3.2.P.2.2.1 Formulation Development The drug product kit components used for compounding of Hyperpolarized Pyruvate (13C) Injection in the polarizer differ slightly from the components used for pre-clinical studies and clinical studies GE-101-001 and GE-101-003 (see Section 8.1 Introduction for Item 8 Pharmacology and Toxicology Info). These differences are explained in the following sections and are summarized in Table 1. (a) Pyruvic acid and [1-13C]pyruvic acid Drug product used for clinical studies GE-101-001 and GE-101-003 was not hyperpolarized. As the need for 13C enriched material was not present, the drug substance used was pyruvic acid, whereas the drug substance used for compounding of Hyperpolarized Pyruvate (13C) Injection is [1-13C]pyruvic acid. Some pre-clinical safety studies were also conducted using pyruvic acid (see Section 8.1 Introduction for Item 8 Pharmacology and Toxicology Info). (b) Content of AH111501 sodium salt AH111501 is removed during compounding of Hyperpolarized Pyruvate (13C) Injection, and the content of this excipient in the final drug product is NMT 3.0 μM. To mimic this situation for clinical studies GE-101-001 and GE-101-003, 0.2 mM AH111501 sodium salt was added to the pyruvic acid in order to obtain 3.0 μM AH111501 in the Pyruvate Injection. For most of the pre- clinical studies (see Section 8.1 Introduction for Item 8 Pharmacology and Toxicology Info) and for compounding of Hyperpolarized Pyruvate (13C) Injection, 15 mM AH111501 sodium salt is added to the [1-13C]pyruvic acid. (c) Content of [1-13C]pyruvate in drug product The drug product was initially formulated to contain 500 mM [1-13C]pyruvate. For this formulation, a Mixture of [1-13C]pyruvic acid and AH111501 sodium salt, containing 2.23 g [1- 13C]pyruvic acid, was dissolved in 50 ml TRIS/EDTA dissolution medium, containing 360 mM NaOH, 200 mM TRIS and 100 mg/l Na EDTA. Because pre-clinical studies using this 2 formulation revealed cardiovascular effects (see Sections 8.2.4.3 Effects on the Cardiovascular Systems (CVS) in the Pentobarbital/Fentanyl Anesthetized Dog, subsections a and b, for Item 8 Pharmacology and Toxicology Info) the product was later reformulated to contain 250 mM [1- 13C]pyruvate. For this formulation, Mixture of [1-13C]pyruvic acid and AH111501 sodium salt, containing 2.23 g [1-13C]pyruvic acid, was dissolved in 100 ml TRIS/EDTA dissolution medium, containing 180 mM NaOH, 100 mM TRIS and 100 mg/l Na EDTA. Some pre- clinical studies 2 were performed with the formulation targeted 500 mM [1-13C]pyruvate. For most pre-clinical (see Section 8.1 Introduction for Item 8 Pharmacology and Toxicology Info) and all clinical studies, the Pyruvate (13C) Injection is targeted to contain 250 mM [1-13C]pyruvate. (d) TRIS/EDTA dissolution medium and TRIS/EDTA buffer solution For clinical studies GE-101-001 and GE-101-003 and pre-clinical studies, the Mixture of pyruvic acid and AH111501 sodium salt was dissolved in TRIS/EDTA dissolution medium in a single step by manual dissolution (see section 3.2.P.2.3 Manufacturing Process Development).

3.2.P.2.3,45,Manufacturing Process Development (Hyperpolarized Pyruvate (13C) Injection),"The procedure for compounding of Hyperpolarized Pyruvate (13C) Injection was not used for pre- clinical studies or clinical studies GE-101-001 and GE-101-003. The Pyruvate (13C) Injection for these studies was prepared by manual mixing of the drug product kit components as described in the following section. Prior to mixing the drug product kit components, the components were allowed to reach ambient room temperature. 100 mL of TRIS/EDTA dissolution medium was then added to the vial containing the Mixture of [1-13C]pyruvic acid and 15 mM AH111501 sodium salt. Immediately, the vial was vigorously shaken for at least 30 seconds to assure homogeneity. The vial was then heated in a 80°C water bath for 10 minutes and cooled in cold tap water for 5 minutes. The vial is then stored in a 37°C water bath for a maximum of 4 hours before use."
3.2.P.3.3,46,Description of Manufacturing Process and Process Controls (Hyperpolarized Pyruvate (13C) Injection),"Hyperpolarized Pyruvate (13C) Injection is compounded at the clinical site prior to administration. For compounding, the Mixture of [1-13C]pyruvic acid and 15 mM AH111501 sodium salt is hyperpolarized by Dynamic Nuclear Polarization (DNP) for approximately 60 minutes at 1.2 K. After hyperpolarization, the Mixture of [1-13C]pyruvic acid and 15 mM AH111501 sodium salt is dissolved in sterile WFI and the AH111501 is then removed from the hyperpolarized solution by mechanical filtration. The hyperpolarized solution is then neutralized, buffered and diluted in TRIS/EDTA buffer solution and subsequently passed through a sterilizing filter (0.2 μm) into the final drug product container, an empty sterile disposable Medrad syringe. The SpinLab system used for hyperpolarization and compounding is located in an area adjacent to the MR scanner room. All compounding process steps are in accordance with USP <797> Pharmaceutical Compounding – Sterile Preparations. Immediately after compounding, the Hyperpolarized Pyruvate (13C) Injection is sampled and tested by an automatic quality control instrument (QC System). The final release authorization for administration to humans will be performed by a licensed pharmacist. After release, the Hyperpolarized Pyruvate (13C) Injection will be delivered to the adjoining MR scanner room for patient administration. 3.2.P.3.3.1 Process description (a) Compounding and filling of empty sterile fluid path All process steps for compounding and filling of the empty sterile fluid path (SFP) used in SpinLab to prepare the hyperpolarized (13C) pyruvate injection are performed within a cleanroom ISO 5 area. A clean, sterile, empty SFP is aseptically removed from its packaging and placed into the ISO 5 area. The sterile water for injection (38 g) is aseptically introduced into the dissolution syringe of the SFP and another 18.5 g of sterile water for injection is aseptically introduced into the receiving vessel. The sterile TRIS/EDTA buffer (18 g) is aseptically introduced into the receiving vessel. A mixture of [1-13C]pyruvic acid and 15 mM AH111501 is prepared and then sterilized using a sterilizing filter (0.2 µm) and 1.47 g of the sterile solution is placed into the sterile cryovial. The cyrovial containing the sterile mixture of [1-13C]pyruvic acid and 15 mM AH111501 is then attached to the empty sterile fluid path and sealed utilizing a laser welder. The cryovial is then"
3.2.P.3.4,50,Controls of Critical Steps and Intermediates (Hyperpolarized Pyruvate (13C) Injection),"A schematic representation of the process flow and the in-process controls is presented in Figure 1 in Section 3.2.P.3.3.1 (a). The polarizer software application monitors and controls critical system and process functions and settings such as data communication and temperature settings. Malfunctions or settings detected to be outside pre-set ranges are communicated to the operators via software-generated alarms that prevent further processing. Control of the mechanical functionality of process hardware, such as valves and fittings, and of the He driving pressure, is performed manually by the operator. The final release analyses performed by the QC System ensure that the compounding process has executed as intended and that the Hyperpolarized Pyruvate (13C) Injection is within specifications (see Table 1 in Section 3.2.P.5.1). The post-administration integrity test of the sterilizing filter assesses whether the filter was functional during use."
3.2.P.3.5,50,Process Validation and/or Evaluation (Hyperpolarized Pyruvate (13C) Injection),"3.2.P.3.5.1 IQ/OQ/PQ Program The clean room, polarizer, process equipment and QC system have gone through an extensive IQ/OQ/PQ program prior to use during clinical trials. The clean room and equipment were found to be suitable for their intended use. 3.2.P.3.5.2 Microbiological aspects The compounding process has been validated by simulation of the process using a microbial nutrient medium. No growth has been observed in any of the media fill batches. The microbiological quality has also been demonstrated by sterility and microbial endotoxin testing of repeated runs (n=6). 3.2.P.3.5.3 Compounding process consistency The consistency of the compounding process has been evaluated by repeated (n=10) compounding of Mixture of [1-13C]pyruvic acid and 15 mM AH111501 sodium salt and TRIS/EDTA buffer solution. All batches were within specifications (see Section 3.2.P.5.4 Batch Analyses for details). As the QC System only determines a limited set of quality parameters, all batches were also analyzed for related substances of [1-13C]pyruvate and TRIS, assay of [1-13C]pyruvate, osmolality and particulate contamination. Because of limited analytical capability at the site of compounding (UCSF), samples were shipped to GE Healthcare and analyses were performed 8 to 34 days after compounding. The formation of AH112615 after compounding (see Section 3.2.P.5.5 Characterization of Impurities) causes a decrease in the assay of [1-13C]pyruvate. Because of this"
3.2.P.4,51,Control of Excipients (Hyperpolarized Pyruvate (13C) Injection),"There are no excipients added during compounding of Hyperpolarized Pyruvate (13C) Injection. All excipients in the drug product are attributed to the drug product kit components; Mixture of [1-13C]pyruvic acid and 15 mM AH111501 sodium and TRIS/EDTA buffer solution. Excipients in the drug product kit components are discussed in Section 3.2.P.4 Control of Excipients for Drug Product Kit Components and Section 3.2.A.3 Novel Excipients. Sample not for submission effect, and as the HPLC method does not detect AH112615, for this study determination of [1- 13C]pyruvate content was performed by quantitative 1H NMR analysis using acetate as an internal standard for calibration. It has been shown that the content of AH112615 immediately after compounding is negligible (see Section 3.2.P.5.5 Characterization of Impurities). To determine the content of [1-13C]pyruvate at time of compounding at UCSF, the AH112625 peak was therefore integrated as [1-13C]pyruvate. The formation of AH112615 also causes a decrease in osmolality with time after compounding. For this study the osmolality at time of compounding at UCSF was therefore calculated from the measured osmolality and the content of AH112615 (determined by 1H NMR) at time of analysis. Results from these analyses are stated in Table 1. As can be seen from these results, the assay of [1-13C]pyruvate in (Hyperpolarized Pyruvate (13C) Injection) varied in the range of 222-252 mM with an average of 241 ± 12 mM. Although the observed assay displays a larger variance than would be expected from the drug product kit components used the results are considered to demonstrate an acceptable process consistency. It should be noted that even though the QC system does not determine the assay of [1-13C]pyruvate, the determination of pH constitute a relevant indirect control of this parameter. The level of control obtained through the determination of pH has been investigated in a study where a sample of Mixture of [1- 13C]pyruvic acid and 15 mM AH111501 sodium salt was titrated with TRIS/EDTA buffer solution diluted in sterile WFI. Results from this study are shown in Figure 1. As can be seen from Figure 1 the pH of the solution is a well defined function of the [1- 13C]pyruvate concentration. As expected, the pKa of TRIS is observed at approximately 8.1 and the depletion of buffer capacity towards the acidic range is observed at approximately 280 mM. Estimated from the observed relationship, the specification to pH (6.7 to 8.0) is equivalent to approximately 210 to 270 mM Pyruvate. With regards to the efficacy of the drug product, the 13C NMR determined by the QC system is proportional to the concentration of [1-13C]pyruvate (see Section 3.2.P.5.2.1 Analytical Procedures). As the 13C nuclear polarization reported by the QC system assumes a fixed concentration of [1-13C]pyruvate, it varies linearly with the actual concentration of [1- 13C]pyruvate. Hence, this parameter represents a more relevant assurance of product efficacy than the assay of [1-13C]pyruvate alone. Osmolality varied in the range of 484-513 mOsm/kg with an average of 501 ± 12 mOsm/kg. Particulate contamination was well within the pharmacopoeia limits for all batches. The purity profile observed during this study was as expected from the purity profile of the drug product kit components. No new impurities were observed. With regards to the purity profile of Hyperpolarized Pyruvate (13C) Injection at time of compounding at UCSF, reference is made to 3.2.P.5.5 Characterization of Impurities. 3.2.P.4 Control of Excipients (Hyperpolarized Pyruvate (13C) Injection) There are no excipients added during compounding of Hyperpolarized Pyruvate (13C) Injection.

3.2.P.5.2,53,Analytical Procedures (Hyperpolarized Pyruvate (13C) Injection),"The 13C nuclear polarization of Hyperpolarized Pyruvate (13C) Injection undergoes an exponential decay with a time constant of approximately 69 seconds. In order to preserve an acceptable imaging efficacy, the time between start dissolution and start of administration to the patient has to be NMT 50s (see Section 3.2.P.8.1 Stability Summary and Conclusions). Due to this limited user window, analyses to control Hyperpolarized Pyruvate (13C) Injection are performed using an automated analytical system (QC System) that determines a limited set of parameters within a time span of approximately 10s. This QC System is specifically developed for the analysis of Hyperpolarized Pyruvate (13C) Injection immediately prior to administration to the patients. The QC accessory participates in the dissolution process by managing the state of the sterile fluid path. Specifically, the QC accessory controls the upper slide valve, which is used to isolate the receiver from the EPA filter, and the lower slide valve which controls fluid flow to the cuvettes and the Administration syringe. After a dissolution is complete, the QC accessory closes the upper slide valve, measures the temperature of the receiver, and opens the lower slide valve to allow the mixed solution to be drawn out. Once the cuvettes and NMR bulb are filled, the QC measures the pyruvate concentration, EPA concentration, and pH. The percent polarization is also measured. Once the Administration syringe is filled, the QC checks that the volume is above the level of a threshold sensor. All measurement results are reported to the Hyperpolarizer, where they are interpreted and displayed on the screen for an operator to decide how to proceed. After completed analysis, the software performs a comparison of the results to a pre-set list of specifications (see Table 1 in Section 3.2.P.5.1 Specifications) and reports the compliance or non-compliance of the Hyperpolarized Pyruvate (13C) Injection to the specifications. Control of additional parameters is assured through testing performed on the combination of the drug product kit components; Mixture of [1-13C]pyruvic acid and 15 mM AH111501 sodium salt dissolved in WFI and TRIS/EDTA buffer solution (Pyruvate (13C) Injection) (see Section"

The dissolution process during compounding of Hyperpolarized Pyruvate (13C) Injection is different from the manual procedure, particularly with regards to parameters such as time, temperature, flow rates and pressure. These differences influence the purity profile such that the impurities in manually dissolved Pyruvate (13C) Injection, to some extent, are different from those in Hyperpolarized Pyruvate (13C) Injection. These effects and the purity profile of Hyperpolarized Pyruvate (13C) Injection are discussed in Sections 3.2.P.5.5.2, 3.2.P.5.5.3 and 3.2.P.5.5.4. 3.2.P.5.5.2 Transformation between AH113462 and AH112623 During and after manual compounding of Pyruvate (13C) Injection, the major impurity in the drug substance, AH113462/E, transforms through AH113462/K to AH112623 (see Section 3.2.P.5.5.1 (a) Transformation of the [1-13C]pyruvic acid purity profile for Drug Product Kit Components). As the dissolution step during the semi-automated compounding of Hyperpolarized Pyruvate (13C) Injection takes place in less than 10 seconds and the product is administered within 50s from start of dissolution, the transformation from AH113462/E to AH112623 will not be complete.

3.2.P.8.1,61,Stability Summary and Conclusion (Hyperpolarized Pyruvate (13C) Injection),"The stability-indicating parameter for Hyperpolarized Pyruvate (13C) Injection is the level of 13C nuclear polarization, which decays rapidly after compounding. The stability testing performed has therefore been limited to determination of the 13C nuclear polarization and relaxation time (T1). 3.2.P.8.1.1 Batches tested Stability testing has been performed on six samples of Hyperpolarized Pyruvate (13C) Injection compounded from Mixture of [1-13C]pyruvic acid and 15 mM AH111501 sodium salt batch FFF106/140-806 and TRIS/EDTA buffer solution batch FFF106/142-806. 3.2.P.8.1.2 Storage conditions and testing frequency Testing was performed inside an MRI scanner located next to the clean room where the compounding of the sample took place. For testing frequency, see Section 3.2.P.8.1.3 Analytical Procedures and Specification. 3.2.P.8.1.3 Analytical procedures and specification The level of 13C nuclear polarization was determined using a 3T MRI scanner. The hyperpolarized 13C NMR signal was obtained using a 5 degree RF pulse. During the relaxation of the non-equilibrium polarization, a total of 64 spectra with 5 degree pulse and TR=3s were collected; the first of which was used for calculating 13C polarization. The relaxation time (13C T1) was calculated by fitting these data to a mono-exponential decay curve. After relaxation to thermal equilibrium, a thermal 13C NMR spectrum was collected (90 degree pulse, 64 averages, TR=10s, after addition of 10 μl Gd/ml solution) in order to calculate the 13C polarization. No shelf-life specifications have been established for Hyperpolarized Pyruvate (13C) Injection. Assurance of quality at time of administration rests on analyses performed before release and the time limit for administration after the dissolution step is completed, which is stated in the imaging"
