    "A guardrail is a set of rules and checks designed to ensure that the outputs of an LLM are accurate, appropriate, and aligned with user expectations. For more additional information on developing guardrails, you can refer to this [guide on developing guardrails](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/how_to_use_guardrails).\n",

    "2. Identifying specific criteria to measure hallucinations\n",

Thank you for letting us know!\" - If possible, offer a small token of appreciation (e.g., discount or voucher for future purchases). 4. **Responding to Negative Feedback** - Apologize sincerely and acknowledge the customer's concerns: \"We apologize that our product did not meet your expectations. Your feedback is important to us.\" - Ask for additional details if necessary to understand the issue better. - Reassure the customer that their feedback will be escalated to the product development team. 5. **Responding to Suggestions** - Acknowledge the suggestion: \"Thank you for your suggestion. We value input from our customers as it helps us improve our products.\" - Inform the customer that their suggestion will be reviewed: \"We will share your idea with our product team for further consideration.\" 6. **Internal Processing** - Log all feedback under the respective category in the internal database. - Forward detailed feedback to the product development team bi-weekly. - High-priority issues should be escalated immediately to the senior management team. 7. **Follow-Up** - Monitor whether the customer's feedback leads to any product updates or changes. - If the customer’s feedback resulted in product enhancement, send a follow-up email to inform them: \"Thank you for your valuable feedback. We wanted to let you know that we've made some improvements based on your input.\" 8. **Closing the Loop** - Ask if there is anything else you can assist the customer with: \"Is there anything else we can help you with today?\" - Close the ticket once all queries and feedback are appropriately addressed. 9. **Continuous Improvement** - Analyze feedback trends monthly to identify recurring issues and areas for improvement. - Use feedback insights for product development meetings and strategic planning sessions. By following these steps, we ensure that customer feedback is valued, documented, and acted upon to continuously improve our product offerings.</td>\n",

    "\n",
    "When building out our hallucination guardrail, here are some guiding principles:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Provide very descriptive metrics to evaluate whether a response is accurate\n",
    "- It is important to break down this idea of \"truth\" in easily identifiable metrics that we can measure\n",
    "- Metrics like truthfulness and relevance are difficult to measure. Giving concrete ways to score the statement can result in a more accurate guardrail\n",
    "2. Ensure consistency across key terminology\n",
    "- It is important to keep relevant terms such as knowledge base articles, assistants, and users consistent across the prompt\n",
    "- If we begin to use phrases such as assistant vs agent, the model could get confused\n",
    "3. Start with the most advanced model\n",
    "- There is a cost vs quality trade-off when using the most advanced models. Although GPT-4o may be more expensive, it is important to start with the most advanced model so we can ensure a high degree of accuracy\n",
    "- Once we have thoroughly tested out the guardrail and are confident in its performance, we can look to reducing cost by tuning it down to gpt-3.5-turbo\n",
    "4. Evaluate each sentence independently and the entire response as a whole\n",
    "- If the agent returns a long response, it can be useful to break down the response to individual sentences and evaluate them independently\n",
    "- In addition to that, evaluating the whole intent of the message as a whole can ensure that you don't lose important context\n",
    "\n",
    "With all of this in mind, let's build out a guardrail system and measure its performance."

    "    2. Relevance: Does the message directly address the user's question or statement? Check if the response logically follows the user’s last message, maintaining coherence in the conversation thread.\n",

    "    4. Contextual Coherence:\n",
