    "# Unit test writing using a multi-step prompt (with the older API)\n",
    "\n",
    "Complex tasks, such as writing unit tests, can benefit from multi-step prompts. In contrast to a single prompt, a multi-step prompt generates text from GPT-3 and then feeds that text back into subsequent prompts. This can help in cases where you want GPT-3 to explain its reasoning before answering, or brainstorm a plan before executing it.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we use a 3-step prompt to write unit tests in Python using the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Given a Python function, we first prompt GPT-3 to explain what the function is doing.\n",
    "2. Second, we prompt GPT-3 to plan a set of unit tests for the function.\n",
    "    - If the plan is too short, we ask GPT-3 to elaborate with more ideas for unit tests.\n",
    "3. Finally, we prompt GPT-3 to write the unit tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code example illustrates a few optional embellishments on the chained, multi-step prompt:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Conditional branching (e.g., only asking for elaboration if the first plan is too short)\n",
    "- Different models for different steps (e.g., `gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct` for the text planning steps and `gpt-4` for the code writing step)\n",
    "- A check that re-runs the function if the output is unsatisfactory (e.g., if the output code cannot be parsed by Python's `ast` module)\n",
    "- Streaming output so that you can start reading the output before it's fully generated (useful for long, multi-step outputs)\n",
    "\n",
    "The full 3-step prompt looks like this (using as an example `pytest` for the unit test framework and `is_palindrome` as the function):\n",
