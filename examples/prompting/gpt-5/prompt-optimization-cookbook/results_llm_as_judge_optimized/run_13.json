For k < unique tokens, it uses heapq.nsmallest(k, ..., key=key). nsmallest returns items in sorted order by the given key, thus producing the exact required ordering.\\n- Requirement 2 (set top_k, correct length): Assigns top_k to the return value of top_k_tokens(text, k), which returns a list of (token, count) tuples. Length is min(k, number of unique tokens) due to either full sort when k >= U or nsmallest(k, ...).\\n- Requirement 3 (edge k <= 0): top_k_tokens returns [] when k <= 0, so top_k is set to [].\\n- Requirement 4 (no input/file/network; runs with provided globals): No input(), file I/O, or network used. With provided globals, the script sets top_k directly without printing. The optional demo path only runs when globals are missing and __name__ == \\\"__main__\\\".\\n- Output contract: With provided globals, top_k is defined at end as specified. Optional printing is only in the demo case and prints only top_k as a Python literal on the last line.
