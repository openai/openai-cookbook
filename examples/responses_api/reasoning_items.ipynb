    "We've recently released two new state-of-the-art reasoning models, o3 and o4-mini, that excel at combining reasoning capabilities with agentic tool use. What many folks don't know is that you can improve their performance by fully leveraging our (relatively) new Responses API. This cookbook shows how to get the most out of these models and explores how reasoning and function calling work behind the scenes. By giving the model access to previous reasoning items, we can ensure it operates at maximum intelligence and lowest cost."

In our tests, switching from the Completions API to the Responses API boosted cache utilization from 40% to 80%.

For example, during conversations with multiple function calls, users can see both which functions were called and the reasoning behind each call—without waiting for the final assistant message. This adds transparency and interactivity to your application’s user experience."
