    "In this quickstart you will learn how to build a \"philosophy quote finder & generator\" using OpenAI's vector embeddings and [Apache Cassandra®](https://cassandra.apache.org), or equivalently DataStax [Astra DB through CQL](https://docs.datastax.com/en/astra-serverless/docs/vector-search/quickstart.html), as the vector store for data persistence.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic workflow of this notebook is outlined below. You will evaluate and store the vector embeddings for a number of quotes by famous philosophers, use them to build a powerful search engine and, after that, even a generator of new quotes!\n",

    "The notebook exemplifies some of the standard usage patterns of vector search -- while showing how easy is it to get started with the vector capabilities of [Cassandra](https://cassandra.apache.org/doc/trunk/cassandra/vector-search/overview.html) / [Astra DB through CQL](https://docs.datastax.com/en/astra-serverless/docs/vector-search/quickstart.html).\n",

    "### How it works\n",
    "\n",
    "**Indexing**\n",
    "\n",
    "Each quote is made into an embedding vector with OpenAI's `Embedding`. These are saved in the Vector Store for later use in searching. Some metadata, including the author's name and a few other pre-computed tags, are stored alongside, to allow for search customization.\n",
    "\n",
    "![1_vector_indexing](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14221764/282440878-dc3ed680-7d0e-4b30-9a74-d2d66a7394f7.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Search**\n",
    "\n",
    "To find a quote similar to the provided search quote, the latter is made into an embedding vector on the fly, and this vector is used to query the store for similar vectors ... i.e. similar quotes that were previously indexed. The search can optionally be constrained by additional metadata (\"find me quotes by Spinoza similar to this one ...\").\n",
    "\n",
    "![2_vector_search](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14221764/282440908-683e3ee1-0bf1-46b3-8621-86c31fc7f9c9.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The key point here is that \"quotes similar in content\" translates, in vector space, to vectors that are metrically close to each other: thus, vector similarity search effectively implements semantic similarity. _This is the key reason vector embeddings are so powerful._\n",
    "\n",
    "The sketch below tries to convey this idea. Each quote, once it's made into a vector, is a point in space. Well, in this case it's on a sphere, since OpenAI's embedding vectors, as most others, are normalized to _unit length_. Oh, and the sphere is actually not three-dimensional, rather 1536-dimensional!\n",
    "\n",
    "So, in essence, a similarity search in vector space returns the vectors that are closest to the query vector:\n",
    "\n",
    "![3_vector_space](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14221764/262321363-c8c625c1-8be9-450e-8c68-b1ed518f990d.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Generation**\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a suggestion (a topic or a tentative quote), the search step is performed, and the first returned results (quotes) are fed into an LLM prompt which asks the generative model to invent a new text along the lines of the passed examples _and_ the initial suggestion.\n",
    "\n",
