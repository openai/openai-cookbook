    "# Using Hologres as a vector database for OpenAI embeddings\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook guides you step by step on using Hologres as a vector database for OpenAI embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook presents an end-to-end process of:\n",
    "1. Using precomputed embeddings created by OpenAI API.\n",
    "2. Storing the embeddings in a cloud instance of Hologres.\n",
    "3. Converting raw text query to an embedding with OpenAI API.\n",
    "4. Using Hologres to perform the nearest neighbour search in the created collection.\n",
    "5. Provide large language models with the search results as context in prompt engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Hologres\n",
    "\n",
    "[Hologres](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/en/hologres/latest/what-is-hologres) is a unified real-time data warehousing service developed by Alibaba Cloud. You can use Hologres to write, update, process, and analyze large amounts of data in real time. Hologres supports standard SQL syntax, is compatible with PostgreSQL, and supports most PostgreSQL functions. Hologres supports online analytical processing (OLAP) and ad hoc analysis for up to petabytes of data, and provides high-concurrency and low-latency online data services. Hologres supports fine-grained isolation of multiple workloads and enterprise-level security capabilities. Hologres is deeply integrated with MaxCompute, Realtime Compute for Apache Flink, and DataWorks, and provides full-stack online and offline data warehousing solutions for enterprises.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hologres provides vector database functionality by adopting [Proxima](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/en/hologres/latest/vector-processing).\n",
    "\n",
    "Proxima is a high-performance software library developed by Alibaba DAMO Academy. It allows you to search for the nearest neighbors of vectors. Proxima provides higher stability and performance than similar open source software such as Facebook AI Similarity Search (Faiss). Proxima provides basic modules that have leading performance and effects in the industry and allows you to search for similar images, videos, or human faces. Hologres is deeply integrated with Proxima to provide a high-performance vector search service.\n",
