    "# Using Nile as a vector store with OpenAI\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will walk you through using Nile's Serverless Postgres as a vector store for embeddings generated by OpenAI. \n",
    "We'll show you how to:\n",
    "    - Create a database with a table to store your embeddings in Nile (using the built-in `pg_vector` extension)\n",
    "    - Load pre-computed embeddings, generated by OpenAI, to Nile\n",
    "    - Generate embeddings for a text query\n",
    "    - Search the stored embeddings with vector distance functions to find documents relevant to the text query\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Nile?\n",
    "\n",
    "Nile is a Postgres platform specifically designed for AI-Native B2B companies, enabling to launch and scale quickly, securely, and in the most cost-effective manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nile's architecture provides the following key benefits:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Built-in tenant virtualization in Postgres for better data and vector embedding isolation.\n",
    "- Vector embedding store that is cost-effective and auto-scales to billions of embeddings across customers\n",
    "- Seamlessly autoscales as your customer's usage increases and scales to zero with no cold start time\n",
    "- User management built for multitenancy with user data stored in your Postgres database and unlimited active tenants and users.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can read more about Nile, its architecture and concepts in our [documentation](https://www.thenile.dev/docs/getting-started)"

    "Before starting this tutorial, you'll need to have the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Connection string to a Nile Postgres database. You can create one by signing up to [Nile](https://console.thenile.dev). After you create a database, generate credentials and copy the connection string from \"Settings\" page.\n",
    "- OpenAI API Key. If you don't have an OpenAI API key, you can get one from [https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys](https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys).\n",
    "\n",
    "After you have both strings, set them as environment variables. Note that if you are running this notebook locally, you'll need to reload the terminal and the notebook to pick up the environment:"
