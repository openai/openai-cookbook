    "This notebook presents how to implement a Question Answering system with Langchain, Qdrant as a knowledge based and OpenAI embeddings. If you are not familiar with Qdrant, it's better to check out the [Getting_started_with_Qdrant_and_OpenAI.ipynb](Getting_started_with_Qdrant_and_OpenAI.ipynb) notebook.\n",

    "2. Storing the embeddings in a local instance of Qdrant to build a knowledge base.\n",
    "3. Converting raw text query to an embedding with OpenAI API.\n",
