# SurrealDB

[SurrealDB](https://www.surrealdb.com/docs) is an open-source multi-model database built in Rust with natively supported AI-facing functionality such as [full text](https://surrealdb.com/docs/surrealdb/reference-guide/full-text-search), [vector search](https://surrealdb.com/docs/surrealdb/reference-guide/vector-search), and [graph queries](https://surrealdb.com/docs/surrealdb/models/graph).

## OpenAI Cookbook Examples

Below are guides and resources that walk you through how to use OpenAI embedding models with SurrealDB.
