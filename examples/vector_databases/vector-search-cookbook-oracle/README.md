# 📘 Oracle Vector Search Cookbook  
## Semantic Similarity Search with Oracle Database 23ai

This repository contains a **cloud-first, reproducible cookbook** demonstrating
how to build **semantic similarity search** applications using **Oracle Database 23ai**
native **VECTOR** support and **OpenAI embeddings**.

The cookbook shows how embeddings can be stored **directly inside Oracle Database**,
queried using **SQL-native vector distance functions**, and exposed through both
a **Jupyter Notebook** and an **interactive Streamlit UI**.

---

## 🎥 Interactive Demo (Streamlit UI)

The following short video (≈17 seconds) demonstrates the interactive Streamlit
application built on top of Oracle Vector Search.

📹 **Demo video:**  
[Watch the demo video](assets/oracle_vector_sesrch_demo.mp4)

The demo showcases:
- Natural language queries
- Semantic similarity ranking (vector distance)
- SQL-native vector search executed inside Oracle Database
- Results ranked by semantic closeness (not keyword matching)

---

## 📚 What This Cookbook Covers

- Creating `VECTOR` columns in Oracle Database 23ai
- Storing embeddings directly inside Oracle Database
- Performing semantic similarity search using `VECTOR_DISTANCE`
- Accessing Oracle Vector Search from Python (`python-oracledb`)
- Building an interactive Streamlit UI for semantic search
- End-to-end workflow: **text → embedding → database → similarity search**

---

## 🧑‍🍳 Who This Cookbook Is For

- Developers exploring **Oracle Database 23ai Vector Search**
- Developers building **semantic search or RAG-style applications**
- Python developers working with Oracle Database
- Anyone interested in **native vector capabilities inside Oracle Database**

---

## 🧠 Architecture Overview

1. Text documents are converted into embeddings using OpenAI
2. Embeddings are stored directly in Oracle Database using a `VECTOR` column
3. Similarity search is performed fully inside Oracle using SQL
4. Results are consumed by:
   - a Jupyter Notebook (cookbook walkthrough)
   - a Streamlit web application (interactive demo)

---

## 🗄️ Database Schema

The `documents` table stores both the original text and its vector embedding:

```sql
CREATE TABLE documents (
    id NUMBER GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
    content CLOB,
    embedding VECTOR(1536, FLOAT32, DENSE)
);
```
---

## ⚙️ Environment & Prerequisites

### Common Requirements
- Python **3.10+**
- OpenAI API key (used for embeddings)
- `python-oracledb`
- Oracle Instant Client (Thick mode)
---

## ☁️ Oracle Autonomous AI Database (Primary Target)

This cookbook is **cloud-first** and designed to run primarily on
**Oracle Autonomous AI Database**, where vector search is supported natively.
---
### Prerequisites
- Oracle Autonomous AI Database (23ai)
- Database wallet downloaded
- Database user with privileges to create tables
---
### Environment Variables

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key"
export DB_USER="your_db_user"
export DB_PASSWORD="your_db_password"
export DB_DSN="your_autonomous_db_high"
```
---
Only the connection details differ between Autonomous and local setups. All SQL and Python code remains identical.
---
## 🖥️ Local Oracle Database (Oracle Free / XE)

For local development and testing, the same cookbook can be run against
**Oracle Database Free / XE**.

### Run Oracle Database locally (Docker example)

```bash
docker run -d \
  -p 1521:1521 \
  --name oracle-free \
  -e ORACLE_PASSWORD=mypassword \
  gvenzl/oracle-free:latest
```
Update the database connection details to point to the local instance.

---

## 📦 Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

```
---

## ▶️ Run the Jupyter Cookbook

```bash
jupyter notebook demo.ipynb
```
The notebook walks through:
environment verification
embedding generation
vector storage
semantic similarity search
result interpretation


---

## ▶️ Run the Streamlit Application

```bash
streamlit run app_streamlit.py
```
---
Open in browser:

http://localhost:8501

---

## 🧠 Why Oracle Vector Search?

Unlike external vector databases, Oracle allows embeddings and business data
to live together in the same database, enabling:

- simpler architectures
- transactional consistency
- SQL-native AI workflows
- easier enterprise integration
---

## 🔜 Next Steps

Planned follow-ups for this cookbook:
- Extend the example to a RAG-style workflow
- Add metadata filtering and hybrid search
- Integrate additional Oracle AI features
---

## ✅ Summary

This project serves as a **practical Oracle Vector Search cookbook** showing how
to build semantic search applications using **Oracle Database 23ai** as a
first-class vector store.

The cookbook is:
- cloud-first
- reproducible
- easy to adapt for real-world AI applications
