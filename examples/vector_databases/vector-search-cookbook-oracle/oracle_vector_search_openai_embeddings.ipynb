    "This cookbook serves as a practical, reproductible guide for developers exploring vector search and AI-native workflows with Oracle Database.\n",

    "What was achieved in this demo:\n",
    "- Text data was converted into embeddings in Python\n",
    "- Embeddings were stored directly inside Oracle Database using the VECTOR data type\n",
    "- Semantic similarity search was executed fully in SQL using `VECTOR_DISTANCE`\n",
    "- Results were ranked by semantic closeness, not keyword matching\n",
    "\n",
    "This shows how Oracle Database can act as:\n",
    "- a persistent vector database\n",
    "- a semantic search engine\n",
    "- a foundation for RAG and AI applications\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why this matters\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike external vector stores, Oracle allows embeddings and business data to live together in the same database, enabling:\n",
    "- simpler architectures\n",
    "- transactional consistency\n",
    "- SQL-native AI workflows\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next steps\n",
    "\n",
    "Planned follow-ups for this cookbook:\n",
    "- Add a lightweight Streamlit UI for interactive search\n",
    "- Extend the example to a RAG-style flow\n",
    "- Prepare the content for submission as an OpenAI Cookbook contribution (PR)\n",
