    "# Using Weaviate with OpenAI vectorize module for Hybrid Search\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is prepared for a scenario where:\n",
    "* Your data is not vectorized\n",
    "* You want to run Hybrid Search ([learn more](https://weaviate.io/blog/hybrid-search-explained)) on your data\n",
    "* You want to use Weaviate with the OpenAI module ([text2vec-openai](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/modules/retriever-vectorizer-modules/text2vec-openai)), to generate vector embeddings for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook takes you through a simple flow to set up a Weaviate instance, connect to it (with OpenAI API key), configure data schema, import data (which will automatically generate vector embeddings for your data), and run hybrid search (mixing of vector and BM25 search).\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a common requirement for customers who want to store and search our embeddings with their own data in a secure environment to support production use cases such as chatbots, topic modelling and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Weaviate\n",
    "\n",
    "Weaviate is an open-source vector search engine that stores data objects together with their vectors. This allows for combining vector search with structured filtering.\n",
    "\n",
    "Weaviate uses KNN algorithms to create an vector-optimized index, which allows your queries to run extremely fast. Learn more [here](https://weaviate.io/blog/why-is-vector-search-so-fast).\n",
    "\n",
    "Weaviate let you use your favorite ML-models, and scale seamlessly into billions of data objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Deployment options\n",
    "\n",
    "Whatever your scenario or production setup, Weaviate has an option for you. You can deploy Weaviate in the following setups:\n",
    "* Self-hosted – you can deploy Weaviate with docker locally, or any server you want.\n",
    "* SaaS – you can use [Weaviate Cloud Service (WCS)](https://console.weaviate.io/) to host your Weaviate instances.\n",
    "* Hybrid-SaaS – you can deploy Weaviate in your own private Cloud Service \n",
    "\n",
    "### Programming languages\n",
    "\n",
    "Weaviate offers four [client libraries](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/client-libraries), which allow you to communicate from your apps:\n",
    "* [Python](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/client-libraries/python)\n",
    "* [JavaScript](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/client-libraries/javascript)\n",
    "* [Java](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/client-libraries/java)\n",
    "* [Go](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/client-libraries/go)\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, Weaviate has a [REST layer](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/api/rest/objects). Basically you can call Weaviate from any language that supports REST requests."

    "- **Schema Configuration**: Configure the schema of your data\n",

    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we start this project, we need setup the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* create a `Weaviate` instance\n",
    "* install libraries\n",
    "    * `weaviate-client`\n",
    "    * `datasets`\n",
    "    * `apache-beam`\n",
    "* get your [OpenAI API key](https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys)\n",
    "\n",
    "===========================================================\n",
    "### Create a Weaviate instance\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a Weaviate instance we have 2 options:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. (Recommended path) [Weaviate Cloud Service](https://console.weaviate.io/) – to host your Weaviate instance in the cloud. The free sandbox should be more than enough for this cookbook.\n",
    "2. Install and run Weaviate locally with Docker.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Option 1 – WCS Installation Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "Use [Weaviate Cloud Service](https://console.weaviate.io/) (WCS) to create a free Weaviate cluster.\n",
    "1. create a free account and/or login to [WCS](https://console.weaviate.io/)\n",
    "2. create a `Weaviate Cluster` with the following settings:\n",
    "    * Sandbox: `Sandbox Free`\n",
    "    * Weaviate Version: Use default (latest)\n",
    "    * OIDC Authentication: `Disabled`\n",
    "3. your instance should be ready in a minute or two\n",
    "4. make a note of the `Cluster Id`. The link will take you to the full path of your cluster (you will need it later to connect to it). It should be something like: `https://your-project-name.weaviate.network` \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Option 2 – local Weaviate instance with Docker\n",
    "\n",
    "Install and run Weaviate locally with Docker.\n",
    "1. Download the [./docker-compose.yml](./docker-compose.yml) file\n",
    "2. Then open your terminal, navigate to where your docker-compose.yml file is located, and start docker with: `docker-compose up -d`\n",
    "3. Once this is ready, your instance should be available at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)\n",
    "\n",
    "Note. To shut down your docker instance you can call: `docker-compose down`\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Learn more\n",
    "To learn more, about using Weaviate with Docker see the [installation documentation](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/installation/docker-compose)."
