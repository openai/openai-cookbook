    "### Voice Chatbot with ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this cookbook, we will walk through the process of creating a simple sales chatbot with automatic speech recognition (ASR) and text-to-speech (TTS) capabilities. We'll use a GPT model via the Chat Completions API to drive the conversation with the user. At the end of the interaction, the chatbot will present an order cart containing the items the user wishes to purchase.\n",
    "\n",
    "Voice chatbots based on ASR/TTS can introduce latency due to the speech-to-text and text-to-speech conversion processes. We will explore strategies to minimize this lag to ensure a better conversational flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "Creating an ASR/TTS-based voice chatbot is a three-step process, as outlined below:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Set Up the GPT Model (Text-to-Text Modality)**  \n",
    "Initialize the GPT model with system prompts that define the goal of the conversation, guiding the chatbot's responses toward assisting with sales order placement. The prompts can be set up for a multi-assistant system, where one assistant drives the conversation with the customer and another assistant manages the cart in parallel. Also, set up tools for assistants to use when asking for human help or interacting with each other (such as cart pricing).\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Develop Audio Modules for ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition) and TTS (Text-To-Speech)**  \n",
    "Create an audio interface that listens to the user, records their speech, and forwards the audio data to the ASR solution (such as Whisper) to transcribe it to text. Implement an **VAD (Voice Activity Detection) module** that detects audio from user and segments the audio at silence intervals to send to Whisper model. Keep VAD (Voice Activity Detection) module parameters - threshold of audio amplitude that qualifies as silence, and the duration of silent chunks - configurable based on the environment. Set up a TTS interface that, given an input text, converts the text to audio and relays it back to the user. You can pre-record common phrases to reduce lag.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Create a conversation loop and manage order cart**  \n",
    "Implement a conversation loop where the agent listens to the user and responds back, continuing until an event occurs that breaks the loop, such as a request to speak with a human or another indication of the end of the conversation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Overarching solution architecture is as follows:   \n",

    "For the purposes of this cookbook, we will use an example of an office stationery ordering bot. You can interact with the bot to order general-purpose office products such as pencils, pens, paper clips, writing pads, printing paper, and envelopes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key challenges we want to address are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Ensure customers can only order items that are available.\n",
    "2. Escalate to a human in the loop if the customer requests help or engages in non-order-related conversation.\n",
    "3. Provide an accurate summary of the order with prices to the customer.\n",
    "4. Minimize the lag in the conversation \n",
    "\n",

By carefully crafting the prompts and defining the functions, we ensure that the bot can handle customer interactions smoothly, maintain the flow of conversation, and provide accurate assistance aligned with the objectives of our project.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will initiate a Sales Bot prompt `SALES_BOT_PROMPT` that would drive the interaction with the user, and a `SALES_CART_PROMPT` prompt that would manage the cart. Note that the list of items available for sale are provide as a list of JSON objects `office_stationery_items`. This helps the sales bot and sales cart assistant to understand the available items, and repond the user accordingly.  \n"

    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we developed an interactive and efficient voice chatbot capable of handling sales orders for office stationery. The conversation loop effectively manages user interactions, leveraging the GPT model for intelligent responses and ensuring the user's needs are met—whether by completing an order or escalating to a human agent. We pre-recorded common phrases to improve the latency, and provided visual cues to the user when the model is speaking and listening for coordinated conversation. This setup provides a solid foundation for building advanced voice-based chatbots with order management capabilities.\n",

    "### Tips and Tricks to Improve User Experience for STT/TTS Voice Bot Solutions\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the inherent lag introduced by speech-to-text (STT) and text-to-speech (TTS) conversions, optimizing the user experience is crucial. Here are some strategies to enhance the responsiveness and fluidity of the conversation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Provide Visual Cues**: Implement visual indicators, when possible, to show when the model is speaking or listening, keeping users informed about the bot's status.  \n",
    "- **Chunk Incoming Audio**: Segment incoming audio at silence intervals before processing with Whisper or any ASR solution to reduce latency.  \n",
    "- **Pre-Record Common Phrases**: Use pre-recorded audio for frequently used phrases like welcome messages or notifications about escalating to a human agent, which can save processing time.  \n",
    "- **Keep Responses Concise**: Encourage the model to generate shorter text outputs and abbreviate common responses to speed up TTS processing.  \n",
    "- **Stream Output Audio**: Stream the audio output as it is generated, rather than waiting for the entire audio file to be ready, to provide a more seamless conversational experience.  \n"
