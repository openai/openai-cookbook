    "Ever wanted to translate a podcast into your native language? Translating and dubbing podcasts can make content more accessible to a global audience. This guide will walk you through the process of converting an English audio file into Hindi using OpenAI APIs. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will cover transcription of the audio, translation into target script, text-to-speech conversion into target language, and benchmarking to ensure quality and accuracy. Overall the process flow can be illustrated as follows: \n",

    "A note on semantics used in this Cookbook regarding **Language** and written **Script**. These words are generally used interchangeably, though it's important to understand the distinction given the task at hand. \n",
    "- **Language** refers to the spoken or written system of communication. For instance, Hindi and Marathi are different languages, but both use the Devanagari script. Similarly, English and French are different languages, but are written in Latin script. \n",
    "- **Script** refers to the set of characters or symbols used to write the language. For example, Serbian language traditionally written in Cyrillic Script, is also written in Latin script.\n",

So those are the GPTs, and we can't wait to see what you'll build. We're bringing the same concept to the API. The Assistance API includes persistent threads, so they don't have to figure out how to deal with long conversation history, built-in retrieval, code interpreter, a working Python interpreter in a sandbox environment, and of course, the improved function calling.

We are doubling our minutes per minute tokens for all our installed GPT-4 customers so that it's easier to work, and you can directly request more changes in your API account settings in Darsimhao and Kota. And GPT-4 Turbo is 3x cheaper than GPT-4 for Prompt Tokens and 2x cheaper for Completion Tokens. Starting today, we are very excited to present GPTs. GPT-Chat is a ready-made culture for GPT's special purpose, and because it combines instructions, extensive knowledge, and cards, it can be very helpful for you. It can work in many situations, and it can give you better control. We know that many people who want to make a GPT don't know how to code. We've made it so that you can just talk and program a GPT. You can make private GPTs. You can share your creations with any user through a link. Or if you're in the chat GPT enterprise, you can make GPTs just for your company. And at the end of this month, we're going to launch a GPT store. So these are the GPTs, and we're very excited to see what you're going to build. We're bringing this concept to the API as well. In the Assistance API, there are fixed threads, so you don't have to figure out how to deal with the history of long conversations. Built-in retrieval, code interpreter, a Python interpreter that works in a sandbox environment, and definitely improved function calling. As intelligence becomes integrated everywhere, we will all get superpowers on demand. We are excited to see what all of you will do with this technique. And to discover new futures, which we will all prepare together. We hope that you will come back next year. Today, what we have launched will look much better than what we are building for you. Thank you for everything you do. Thank you for coming here today.\n"

    "\n",
    "0 to 10: Poor quality translation; significant errors and lack of fluency.\n",
    "\n",
    "10 to 20: Low quality; understandable in parts but contains many errors.\n",

    "#### 1. Is the source audio accurately transcribed? \n",
    "Revisit parameters `glossary_of_transcription_errors` and add text that has incorrect transcriptions.  \n",

    "#### 2. Is the transcribed text free of grammatical errors? \n",
    "Consider using a post-processing step with GPT model to refine the transcription to remove grammatical mistakes and add appropriate punctuations. \n",

    "#### 3. Are there words that make sense to keep in the original language?  \n",
    "There may be new terms or concepts for which a translation in target language may not exist or is not universally understood. Revisit `glossary_of_terms_to_keep_in_original_language` and add such terms."

    "\n",
    "To recap this cookbook provides a step-by-step process for translating and dubbing audio from one language to another, making content more accessible to a global audience. The example we used is voice translation of an audio file from English to Hindi. The steps are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Transcription**: Using OpenAI's Whisper to transcribe the English audio into text.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Translation**: Converting the transcribed English text into Hindi, specifically in the Devanagari script.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Text-to-Speech**: Transforming the translated text into spoken Hindi using a text-to-speech service.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Benchmarking**: Evaluating the quality and accuracy of the translation with metrics like BLEU or ROUGE and refining the results by adjusting parameters throughout the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "The guide also clarifies the distinction between \"language\" and \"script,\" which are often used interchangeably but have specific meanings critical to the translation task. Language refers to the spoken or written system of communication, while script refers to the characters used to write the language. Understanding this distinction is key to effectively translating and dubbing content. "
