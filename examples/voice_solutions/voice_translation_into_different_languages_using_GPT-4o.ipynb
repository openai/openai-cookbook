    "### Voice Translation of Audio Files into Different Languages Using Gpt-4o\n",
    "\n",
    "Have you ever wanted to translate a podcast into your native language? Translating and dubbing audio content can make it more accessible to audiences worldwide. With GPT-4o's new audio-in and audio-out modality, this process is now easier than ever.\n",
    "\n",
    "This guide will walk you through translating an English audio file into Hindi using OpenAI's GPT-4o audio modality API.\n",
    "\n",
    "GPT-4o simplifies the dubbing process for audio content. Previously, you had to convert the audio to text and then translate the text into the target language before converting it back into audio. Now, with GPT-4o’s voice-to-voice capability, you can achieve this in a single step with audio input and output.  \n",
    "\n",
    "A note on semantics used in this Cookbook regarding **Language** and written **Script**. These words are generally used interchangeably, though it's important to understand the distinction, given the task at hand.  \n",
    " \n",
    "**- Language** refers to the spoken or written system of communication. For instance, Hindi and Marathi are different languages, but both use the Devanagari script. Similarly, English and French are different languages, but are written in Latin script.  \n",
    "   \n",
    "**- Script** refers to the set of characters or symbols used to write the language. For example, Serbian language traditionally written in Cyrillic Script, is also written in Latin script.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "GPT-4o audio-in and audio-out modality makes it easier to dub the audio from one language to another with one API call.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Transcribe** the source audio file into source language script using GPT-4o. This is an optional step that can be skipped if you already have the transcription of source audio content.  \n",
    " \n",
    "**2. Dub** the audio file from source language directly to the target langauge.  \n",
    "   \n",
    "**3. Obtain Translation Benchmarks** using BLEU or ROUGE.   \n",

    "The function sends an API request to OpenAI's chat/completions endpoint. The request headers include the API key for authorization. The data payload contains the model type (`gpt-4o-audio-preview`), the selected output modalities, and audio details, such as the voice type and format (in this case, \"alloy\" and \"wav\"). It also includes the system prompt and the base64-encoded audio file as part of the \"user\" message. If the API request is successful (HTTP status 200), the response is returned as JSON. If an error occurs (non-200 status), it prints the error code and message.\n",

      "Hello and welcome to our first ever OpenAI DevDay. Today, we are launching a new model, GPT-4 Turbo. GPT-4 Turbo supports up to 128,000 tokens of context. We have a new feature called JSON mode, which ensures that the model will respond with valid JSON. You can now call many functions at once. And it will do better at following instructions in general. You want these models to be able to access better knowledge about the world, so do we. So we're launching retrieval in the platform. You can bring knowledge from outside documents or databases into whatever you're building. GPT-4 Turbo has knowledge about the world up to April of 2023, and we will continue to improve that over time. DALL-E 3, GPT-4 Turbo with Vision, and the new text-to-speech model are all going into the API today. Today, we're launching a new program called Custom Models. With Custom Models, our researchers will work closely with a company to help them make a great custom model, especially for them and their use case using our tools. Higher rate limits. We're doubling the tokens per minute for all of our established GPT-4 customers so that it's easier to do more, and you'll be able to request changes to further rate limits and quotas directly in your API account settings. And GPT-4 Turbo is considerably cheaper than GPT-4, by a factor of 3x for prompt tokens and 2x for completion tokens starting today. We're thrilled to introduce GPTs. GPTs are tailored versions of ChatGPT for a specific purpose. And because they combine instructions, expanded knowledge, and actions, they can be more helpful to you. They can work better in many contexts, and they can give you better control. We know that many people who want to build a GPT don't know how to code. We've made it so that you can program the GPT just by having a conversation. You can make private GPTs. You can share your creations publicly with a link for anyone to use. Or, if you're on ChatGPT Enterprise, you can make GPTs just for your company. And later this month, we're going to launch the GPT Store. So those are GPTs, and we can't wait to see what you'll build. We're bringing the same concept to the API. The Assistant API includes persistent threads so they don't have to figure out how to deal with long conversation history, built-in retrieval, code interpreter, a working Python interpreter in a sandbox environment, and, of course, the improved function calling. As intelligence gets integrated everywhere, we will all have superpowers on demand. We're excited to see what you all will do with this technology and to discover the new future that we're all going to architect together. We hope when you come back next year, what we launch today is going to look very quaint relative to what we're busy creating for you now. Thank you for all you do. Thanks for coming here today.\n"

    "### Step 4. Interpret and improve scores by adjusting prompting parameters in steps 1-3 as needed\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, both BLEU and ROUGE scores indicate that the quality of the voice translation is between very good and excellent.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpreting BLEU Scores:** While there is no universally accepted scale, some interpretations suggest:\n",
    "\n",
    "0 to 10: Poor quality translation; significant errors and lack of fluency.\n",
    "\n",
    "10 to 20: Low quality; understandable in parts but contains many errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "20 to 30: Fair quality; conveys the general meaning but lacks precision and fluency.\n",
    "\n",
    "30 to 40: Good quality; understandable and relatively accurate with minor errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "40 to 50: Very good quality; accurate and fluent with very few errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "50 and above: Excellent quality; closely resembles human translation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpreting ROUGE scores:** The interpretation of a \"good\" ROUGE score can vary depending on the task, dataset, and domain. The following guidelines indicate a good outcome:\n",
    "\n",
    "ROUGE-1 (unigram overlap): Scores between 0.5 to 0.6 are generally considered good for abstractive summarization tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "ROUGE-L (Longest Common Subsequence): Scores around 0.4 to 0.5 are often regarded as good, reflecting the model's ability to capture the structure of the reference text.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the score for your translation is unsatisfactory, consider the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Is the source audio accurately transcribed? \n",
    "If the transcription contains errors, such as confusing similar-sounding words, you can provide a glossary of such terms in the system prompt during step 1. This helps the model avoid misinterpretations and ensures accurate transcription of specific terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Is the source audio free of grammatical errors? \n",
    "If the source audio contains grammatical errors, consider using a post-processing step with the GPT model to refine the transcription by removing grammatical mistakes and adding appropriate punctuation. After this, instead of using GPT-4o’s audio-in and audio-out modality, you can use the corrected transcription with GPT-4o’s text-in and audio-out modality to generate the audio in the target language.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Are there words that make sense to keep in the original language?  \n",
    "Certain terms or concepts may not have a suitable translation in the target language or may be better understood in their original form. Revisit your `glossary_of_terms_to_keep_in_original_language` and include any such terms to maintain clarity and context."

    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, this cookbook offers a clear, step-by-step process for translating and dubbing audio, making content more accessible to a global audience. Using GPT-4o’s audio input and output capabilities, translating and dubbing audio files from one language to another becomes much simpler. Our example focused on translating an audio file from English to Hindi.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process can be broken down into the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Transcription:** Obtain transcription of the source language audio into source language script using GPT-4o text modality.   \n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Dub:** Directly dub the audio file into the target language using GPT-4o's audio modality.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Benchmark Translation Quality:** Evaluate the translation’s accuracy using BLEU or ROUGE scores compared to reference text.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Optimize the Process:** If needed, adjust the prompting parameters to improve the transcription and dubbing results.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This guide also highlights the crucial distinction between \"language\" and \"script\"—terms that are often confused but are essential in translation work. Language refers to the system of communication, either spoken or written, while script is the set of characters used to write a language. Grasping this difference is vital for effective translation and dubbing.\n",
    "\n",
    "By following the techniques in this cookbook, you can translate and dub a wide range of content—from podcasts and training videos to full-length films—into multiple languages. This method applies across industries such as entertainment, education, business, and global communication, empowering creators to extend their reach to diverse linguistic audiences."
