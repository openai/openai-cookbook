# Rubric

This rubric provides a systematic method for assessing the quality of submissions to the OpenAI Cookbook. Each area is rated on a scale from 1 to 5, with 1 being the lowest and 5 being the highest. The purpose of this rating system is to ensure that all contributions maintain a high standard of quality, relevance, and uniqueness.

In general, we will reject contributions that score lower than a 3 in any of the areas. We believe that by maintaining a high standard for submissions, we can provide a better learning experience for everyone who uses the OpenAI Cookbook.

We encourage contributors to familiarize themselves with the rubric before writing an example. This not only increases the chances of your contribution being accepted, but also helps in creating a resource that is comprehensive, clear, and beneficial for all users. Remember, the goal is not just to share knowledge, but to do so in a way that is accessible, engaging, and enriching for the community.
